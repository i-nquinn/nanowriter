"WINDSTORM"

The windstorm came on suddenly,
slamming doors and howling
in the chimney - 
I heard the boxes we had unpacked
move against each other outside. 
I went out and felt the beast
in my hair, forcing itself into my lungs,
whipping away sheets
of packing paper. 
At first I thought I should pick up
what I could,
but then I realized I was tired,
the problem would still be there
in the morning -
so I let that paper fly.


"FRESH AIR"

Your hefty hair 
     a burden to convention.
Your baggy indigo jeans 
sink below the standards of 
good looks.
Your unaware disposition, 
misplaced 
speech make you appear 
anachronous, 
but to me
     to me, you appear 
as simply as the first spring does
     reviving the wilting yellow
flowers of winter


"FIXING"

there’s a procession of hope at the tabernacle of what i call my ancestral 
rites. i wonder if this is how a song dissolves from the rhythm of its 
true purpose, its cadence, everything that makes it music. i wonder if 
it takes god to scar a man, or if it takes a man to scar a man. whichever 
way it is, i find me unfixing myself from the spaces between fail and 
the suffix -ure. i find myself writing my name in all places i should have 
written success. i guess i needed it that bad. i looked into the mirror, and 
pictured my body matching with all the outlines of vanity. at the dead 
of the night, i capture all the silence of what keeps me down and turn 
it into a plethora of noisy roses. this is my ninja way. this is the opening 
of yin and yang on everything that holds up my chakra. & here, i blare 
the gongs of trouble up to keep the eyes of the world on me. i, might 
be a box of matches starting a fire. but i, am also the tears of the cloud 
ending it. 


"HYDRA"

Every breath is fire, your hunger
wraps its tentacles around your own face,
your hunger, your hunger,
so close to the surface. You are so hungry,
in the moonlight your hunger pushes
one tentacle into your face,
testing the depth, testing the resistance
as the fire grows in your lungs. A tentacle,
curious finger, ravenous finger, pushes
one tentacle into your face, 
this time a little pull, and you feel the outside
pressure. You let the hunger take you,
all the fingers, floating, wet,
break through your skin, tear your face,
let the water in, everything it contains,
you contain. You breathe, hold it – 
the hole in you disappears. The hunger waits.


"FUNERAL"

The presence of absence disperses like the aftermath of a forest fire no 
one could smother. A desperate char of ebony spreads over my sheets 
as I wake in the dead of winter. Grief has risen in me before the sun. My 
lover dreams whilst I abandon our bed to choose my mother’s grave.

Natural Burial Grounds are absent of headstones; our site faces the 
Preseli Mountains, the high peaks blurred by fog, unreachable but real.  
I point at the place beneath my feet, tell them to dig and they do. They 
dig with machines but I use my claws like the motherless animal I have 
become. The earth shape shifts to clay under my fingernails, the deeper 
I go the harder my unborn kicks my abdomen. I imagine the grief has set 
with her like a shadow cast by the sun.  

We transform the hole to tomb, adorn it with memories, a photograph, 
Evening Primrose, Amethyst and Magic Mushrooms. We leave no 
epitaph, only blades of grass with roots too shallow to reach my mother 
who is wrapped in two body bags,  the contents of her wicker coffin will 
have to wait a century to biodegrade, a century before the earth can 
love her bones. 


"CINNAMON BIRD"

My nest is spice and fire. Everybody wants 
the cinnamon. Out of reach 
on the sheer cliff of this apartment complex. 

There are so few trees in the city. Nobody remembers 
how I emerged from an egg,
naked and wingless, covered in bark. How I peeled
myself from myself by the skin of my teeth. Each bite 
burned, until I taught myself to swallow 
each ember, a charred mint,
bitter and sharp and, oh, 
how they soothed my butterflies. Nobody sees 
beneath the skin, how hard it was
to grow wings. The nerves built from gallium, 
always molten, contaminating everything 
that touches me. Contaminating everything I touch. How 
the oil-slick blood struggled 
to push raw skin where it wanted to go, 
where it is wanted. The feathers came from ash,
light as smoke, shrouding me 
in gray crystal and mystery. 

My nest is a product of molting. It is lived history – 
the cinnamon is mine, the cinnamon is safe, 
my home, where the sun catches the glass,
and everything is warm, and I can rest.


"STARDUST" 

I conjured you up from stardust,
whispered you into existence
	from lullabies,
devoured galaxies, 
tasted skies 
 left them on your lips,
birthed universes on your tongue, 
entangled supernovas in the spaces 
between your fingers;
the spaces between what's left unsaid
    words: monologues of desires, 
    of pain – 
of pleasure
smothered,
enwrapped
in uneven gasps.
I touched you;
kissed your cheeks
your fingertips
	your navel, and you
you became a god.
My creation
worshipping at the altar of my skin;
tracing scriptures on my back
	engraving holy verses 
	on the insides of my thighs.
Kisses dripping like wax 
from worship candles
Dripping 
Dripping
On my forehead 
On my cheeks
Between my lips
Between my legs 
I conjured you up from stardust,
created you
to devour you.
Every edge,
every cliff
A little closer.
A little farther
Creating,
destroying 
between gasps,
between moans 
traversing lifetimes
within seconds.


"THE TRAGEDY OF TOUCH"

We travelled billions of years
stardust 
    hydrogen, helium, carbon
to inhibit this bone cage,
this flesh chamber,
on a rotating globe
to never be able 
to truly embrace 
	to really hold
	to caress
elements 
ricocheting 
through lifetimes of innumerable stars
supernovas
I hug you,
hold you
	wrap my feet across your ankles
	entangle our fingers in the spaces between
	what is left unsaid
I’m still alone
    isolated – 
in an unfathomably tiny space
created by your electrons repelling my own
    repelling me
I’ll always just be 
	hovering
over everything that I love;
aloof
alone.


"JUNIPER"

Juniper everywhere – 
in the prairie air pressed down 
into the earth, like something dead,
with the season’s sky 
sweet and sticky and humid,
swimming in a teacup. The opposite
of the constant green
dried in the sun, dry as a bone,
nothing to travel on
except the dream of preservation,
the smell of piss. A memory
from childhood, when every branch
still felt soft, 
and nothing dug into you forever.


"FLOODLIGHTS"

Under evening floodlights, we could tell it was going to rain
by the smell in the air, the clouds closing in – 
the obvious signs. We ate hot dogs and drank Coke
before the panic attacks really began. We were talking,
laughing about growing up, children and fortunes,
strokes, hobbies, and forgetting. The smell of hot garbage
and how bee stings were the worst pain we knew. We joked 
about becoming Christmas card friends. It’s been decades,
and none of us know each other’s address. But I remember
sitting behind the home dugout when the sky broke
and the softball tournament got rained out, how we ran
together, too many of us, piled into one car. How
the windows fogged until we couldn’t see anything
except the dashboard, glowing minutes and each other. 


"DRIED LAVENDER"

We kept the lavender in the window, 
and kept bringing it glasses of water. 

What did we think 
was going to happen? What is the cure 
for too much of a good thing? Something
shining. We didn’t think about radiation 
when we carried the rigid, skeletal plant outside.

We treated the green 
until it was gray and crisp
like a spring morning. It never bloomed,
and nobody remembered 
what purple looked like.


"THE HARDNESS OF THINGS"

When I was five years old, I remember,
I watched men on TV topple trees with only axes. I wondered
why my dad needed a steel wedge, hydraulics, a tractor
just to get firewood. It all burns the same. Anyway,
in my teens I was taught about the Mohs scale,
what was strong enough to scratch what, 
and the colors left behind. This was intended 
to make buying jewelry easier for everyone,
and everyone bought it. I am no exception,
I am every crack in the asphalt, chipped sidewalk,
calving glacier, fallen tree, trimmed lawn, 
the boulders dug from the fields to save the plow 
blades. In the dark I sink into memory foam. 
It never remembers me, but it always adjusts. Every day. 
When I wake up I’m still just figuring out 
the hardness of things. 


"GLASS"

The mind is a fragile thing.
I give you a glimpse
Of transparent thoughts,
But under the pressure
You exert,
The framework shatters.
You leave me 
With pieces that stick,
Shards that cut deep
And hurt more
Than the initial impact,
As I try to repair myself,
Like Humpty Dumpty
Putting himself back together—
So I discard those pieces
And forget about being whole again.


"TELEPATHY"

It was always weird to me,
how we weren’t telepaths. How we live
in the same world in our own heads. Somehow we decided 
noise or lines on an impermanent surface weren’t inefficient,
they were enough. We could have everything we needed to
until we couldn’t. So we made music
and painted and put fur on plates and built weapons
and used weapons and wove clothes
and took off clothes and tore stones from the earth
and made trees into children and gave each other flowers
at the end of everything. Nobody understood
the minor languages inside all of us, 
nobody ever talked about it. I just put these lines on a page.


"THEATER"

Small fragments of the stage, embed themselves as shrapnel
in memory. Amorphous bodysuits pounding on PVC pipe
to form a rhythm to everything. We are on a submarine,
and it is burning. In this house, there are birds
having a secret meeting. They are talking about
what comes after this, as well as the first kiss
that brought the couple together. One climbed
down a ladder from a tree, one gave a speech,
and the silence after hung heaviest. The seven deadly sins are
diner conversation. The cigarettes aren’t real anymore,
but the Elvis Costello songs playing quietly are. In the quiet,
people are pretending to be a family,
discussing what was work and what was thought
and what belongs to who. Everything is about want or want not.


"DINOSAURS"

I still dream about dinosaurs.

Some days I connect 
to the oily flow of loneliness,
its spiderweb threading backward 
to days that are only carbon 
on the walls of my skull. I try to remember
first pain, first laugh, kiss, wreck,
rain on a windshield, 
cold sweat on a summer glass,
burning tin and every tunnel I’ve ever been through,
the barrel of a gun. The weight of powder
and lead. Returning to oil and all the mechanisms
that work to bury every sequence deeper,
deeper, beneath more sediment and salt. Oil,
every feeling an extinction event.


"MY BATHTUB TAKES ME TO THE SEA"

Melancholy thunder. I wake and recall,
a nightmare. My lantern shattered on the slipway.
A hand that is not mine guides me
to the water. 

Healing is not for me. 
There are no more boards
for Theseus’ ship. There was never anything
to me. The warmth of my body has always been 
a kind of hunger. See how it reaches toward the light.
A moth. A star. 

Adventure! In the dark. I was built 
for many adventures. I believe in no miracles, 
except myself. I require no heaven. I pray to no one, 
save myself. Her, 
I’ve prayed to. 

I am not old. I wonder 
where we keep our souls. I wonder 
why do we borrow 
fire that must be returned?  
I am not old. For now, 
I am here, preparing
the boat. I am thinking about Shelley,
and triumph and waves. Waves. Waves.

Stay with me for a moment, 
I am not yet brave.


"ALWAYS HUNGRY AND JOYOUS CREATURES"

Last night 
I wanted to tell you a story
about birds, something about their bones,
how hollowness helps make them 
whole. This morning we stood on the rocks
and watched the gulls fly 
over the bay – 

you took my hand
and I didn’t have to say a word.


"SNARES ARE MADE OF LOOPS"

I talk about how much of my life revolves around rabbits
while you count the seconds it takes
to grind the coffee. I talk about Yasmina Reza 
and the last page of Art, how it deals with destruction, loss,
how it connects to a painting that doesn’t exist
about a rabbit that doesn’t exist, 
like talking about it might make it real.
Like Ted didn’t talk more to Sylvia after she was dead. I rewind 
to a sketch by Toyen, a rabbit’s head in the sandcastles,
how they get it wrong, how they make death peaceful. Of course
this leads to remembering my dad, the BB gun, the rabbit and blood,
the night I wouldn’t eat. All of this leads to John Updike – 
	
	you do things and do things and nobody really has a clue.

We go for a walk after breakfast. There’s still frost on the ground.
By the fence of the playground,
a dead rabbit. We say nothing.


"TIN"

If you look closely at a tin can,
you can see the atoms. Not with the naked eye,
mind you. With the proper tools
the holes become clear, the space
heat fills before a sudden collapse,
edges electricity traces. What you are talking about
when you speak about metals
isn’t nobility or conductivity. It’s all about potential
of form and function and future, how sometimes
what holds the soup is really human.


"MACHINERY"

The rain brings what you don’t forget – 
floods, yes, and flowers. Remember frogs
in the low-lying areas, the wandering turtle,
a young god’s excited pulse on the tin roof,
the shuffled smell of minerals rising
from the mud. The growth of rust
on the hollow cars buried 
in the shelter belt. The plum tree exploding its blooms
when the wind sang, and the shine of the amber
reminding everyone that the maple tree is dying
and needs to become fire. Remember
holding that small, gold, crystal ball, 
looking at the tractor through its fish-eye,
dreaming that you could carry machines so easily
you could forget you were carrying them at all.


"SLEEPWALKING"

The sunlight, one morning, broke out of the clouds
and chased down the slowly settling glass of the windows
in the center of campus. I can’t remember why I was awake,
but I remember silver mirrors 
casting purple and orange onto the trees. It was the beginning 
of spring, and the flowers didn’t care
what color the light was. They took it, loved it, gave it back – 
I wish there were more memories like this,
just me and the soft glow in a place that is only the same
when I’m sleepwalking.


"THE FRUIT CELLAR IS EMPTY"

We are here, in a world becoming
desert, winter and summer,
and the green rise of spring seems so distant, here
because our wings are clipped, a chorus singing 
as our ship sinks – the sea of wheat is stripped
to chaff, the branches of the forest bare,
so each note echoes. 

An empty home, nothing but spit 
and horsehair, a little earth, cold and wet 
like a grave. Dry like a bone, our trenches 
carved in wooden years – we are not forgotten,
only wrapped deeper, the seeds of an apple:
a little sweet, a little poison,
still growing, a sleeping tree 
ripe with hope, the poisoned fruit of nostalgia. 

The sun will bring a new day
and rot, and winter will preserve its fragile skeleton,
a reminder:
we do not come into this world
so full of limbs 
to be alone.


"MAKE WHAT THEY CALL REVOLUTION"

We are born from children’s building blocks,
crossword puzzles filled with instinct and disobedience:
a desire to be taller,
to stack ourselves ever skyward
on the bow of a pirate ship,
stolen from the dead, a figurehead to dissolve in a storm
like petals from a rhododendron,
changed like the boards of the lifeboat we adorn,
wood cut from compliments 
tilted like a pinball table, a war table, a barricade, 
walls up against open hands and tactical gunfire alike.
 
An open door is an obvious weakness
in a rat trap, lodged in a coffin
like every legend, bygone like Ozymandias
worn to sand, not standing
anymore – it’s something to be something
burnt and broken, 
with a foundation of toothpicks and I Ching hexagrams
we will rebuild ourselves:
a towering monument.


"WALNUT SHELL"

Some nights, my neck hurts
and I worry I’m dying. 
I’ve seen pictures
of my spine, glowing with arthritis.
I wonder if there’s something wrong
with my bones, my brain,
my heart. I dread being split open
like I’m already dead. Christmas is coming,
like always. There will be cinnamon
and dancing. Every time I hear Tchaikovsky
I think about a jaw unhinging
to crack my ribs, to find the meat. I wonder
if there is anything left to savor.


"PINK NAILS"

Church camp was not a place for God 
as much as it was a place for exploring 
an imaginary existence. Sitting in a circle. 
Campfires. The same circles in our cabin, 
girls on the inside, boys on the outside,
jokes about painting our nails 
bouncing off the cedar walls. The girls flirting 
because they knew, in this case, they were God. 
Big G. I offered them my hands, 
and they showed me the power 
to transform my life. Pink nails on my fingers. 
Small flags to wave. “The glitter looks good,”
they said. It made me feel something 
I couldn’t name. Accepting myself
is a bit like accepting Jesus. I bit my nails 
and tasted the paint, imagined a different life. 
And when we went home I had plain nails 
and a story to tell about something 
that doesn’t make me who I am, 
just something that helped me understand 
who I could be. Salvation. At least for myself.
A lesson forgotten under the watch of my parents,
who just wanted me to be a good boy. I wonder,
now, when I put on a dress, how I could have refused 
a truth, and how those closest to me were blind to it.


"THE SWIMSUIT DREAM"

An ocean sunset. I am smooth and curved 
like a stone. Like the shore of the sea. I am wearing the pink sunset,
in a pink swimsuit, in a field of darkening blue, 
where you can’t tell the sky from the water 
except for the slow stretching of the sun away from the stars. 
And I am happy. I collect shells and watch gulls. Treasures and friends. 
They are shiny and beautiful, and so am I.
It was a wonderful dream, at four. Maybe five. But I woke up, 
and I told my mom, how I felt less like a boy. Kind of like a girl,
and she said she didn’t want to hear it. She was no saint, 
but said it was a disease of sin and shame. She didn’t want to listen
to the soft parts of me that could hold a confession
with without breaking it. I loved myself until she stopped that day.
The truth is whole body that flies and shines,
and I disappeared completely for so long. What is a husk
other than something that has existed and has disappeared 
at the same time? I am trying now to become something else.
Myself. In absolution.


"CRADLE NECROMANCY"

We learn in childhood in unconscious hope. It's a wonder 
we expect a thing to stay the same. I don’t know how 
to deal with my anger sometimes. I dig a hole 
in the back yard to bury the cradle of my youth. This is repetition 
compulsion, this loop, this necromancy. 

My journey is part of the ground, now. A moth flies from the earth, 
gray, soft and frail. Like me or a ghost. Everything is dry. 
A corn husk. A bone. I keep digging until I see the sun, 
mine the hellfire, hold it close. This is what is feels like 
to sew faith into an empty garden. Waiting to grow. 
Days oscillate. Yesterday, tomorrow. 
An anvilhead rises. A hammer of lightning.
It shatters me, but I accept it, 
like the road wears the weather. 
I do nothing but swallow rain and thunder. Watch the water pool 
in the cratered soil.  Every ripple leads to the edge. 


"ROADKILL"

Someone please tell me why we swerve 
for animals that are already dead.

Is it because we fear 
their ghosts will haunt us? Do we want to rubberneck, 
keep an eye on the blood, tuck the image 
in the back of our minds? I fear dying again and again 
in the wheel, where nothing is permanent 
and everything is in flux. The clouds, the rainbow, 
the guardian angels. Do we think they can still feel 
the pain of our tires, or do we hope 
they can still smell the chamomile flowers 
growing near their asphalt graves? 

I fear losing memories 
where small ghosts rebirth themselves 
on the map of my arteries. 

I am not a good traveler. 
My plans are fixed. 
I will arrive. 

Maybe we swerve because we know 
we are already dead too. 
Too simple. What if we swerve 
because we are neither dead nor alive 
but something in between? I fear forgetting 
the way, the power of a compass. 

A flicker of light in the dark, 
a blur of motion in the rain,
it is already gone. We missed it - 
a moment of easy grace in the chaos
where we could look forward to the wonder, grow
unbroken bones. Not every wound is a reason 
to disappear. Drive.


"SPIRIT WEEK DRESS"

I have always loved flowers 
and lace and birds and butterflies. And color! 
I love color. The thing I am most scared of, 
being alive, is not being myself
by the time I’m in the ground with flowers
growing over me.

In high school, for spirit week, 
we had Hat Day and Pajama Day 
and Crossdress Day. In a red state, 
with a pink face, 
I borrowed a blue and gold maxi dress 
from my first girlfriend. 
While she wore one of my hoodies 
and a pair of jeans, I wore a secret 
with confidence. And nobody laughed 
or hit me or shoved me around, 
they just let me walk around 
and giggle and learn. 
And I’ve never forgotten.

More dresses hanging in my closet now 
are a challenge. To become. To return. 
A reminder that curves can be there 
even when they’re not visible. I know 
when I put on the dress I am being 
more honest. I am softening on the outside 
to match the softness that has always been 
inside. The softness I reinforce 
with a scaffolding of farm summers, barbed wire, 
and BB guns and acting smarter than I am,
hoping that age and wisdom
help me fit the future better. 


"WEIGHING THE RAYS OF DEAD STARS"

I pluck a strand of silver from my head 
and hold it 
to the night sky - 
it could be a filament of light 
connecting me to some distant dawn.
It could be an offering.

Do the stars remember their beginnings? 
Do they wade into the void just to feel 
the gravity waves lap against them? 
Do they fear their decay? Life
takes a different meaning
when nobody will know you’re gone 
until you shine brighter. 

What does the future look like 
from a receding horizon,
when I am a still point, burning?

Without even knowing what it’s doing,
gravity pulls my strand of silver 
to the ground, but the hair is inconsequential,
and the wind effortlessly blows it
somewhere else.


"UNTITLED 1"

sometimes 
if you trade scrap metal 
for a tarot card, 
you find yourself kneeling 
under the discipline 
of a spring morning. 

the rain hurts, now,
but you still like water, 
and all the rosemary 
has disappeared 
in your mouth. 

other people 
get to be something. 
you get to be a wasteland 
in dreams
where you never learn.


"UNTITLED 2"

looking back 
on the history of my pulse,
my dreams float in the dark, 
strange and skinless, 
the skeletons 
of a hurricane. 

there is rust
falling like snow 
from the bells
of my cathedral.

once, i was a shrine,
an altar, a borrowed heart -
often I wonder
if becoming a tree
will be worth the pain
I accept just by breathing
and bleeding.


"UNTITLED 3"

i am building a grammar 
of experience. 
 
the lake shore
wants more sand,
more bones. 

the plum tree
is dropping stones
ripe with ghosts.

a bomb 
filled with the breeze 
explodes with a rattle.

anyway, in the future
i already know
i am incomplete.


"UNTITLED 4"

Most days, I dislike being in my skin. 
I would rather be glued
to the sunlight filtering through the sheers.
I wonder how strong the world must be
to keep moving when it hurts.

I have never been strip mined,
but I have shining nostalgia
deposited deep in my sinews.
The beast wants it, the cold shock 
of every new childhood experience.


"OCEAN-FACED"

I knew something was wrong
when you came ocean-faced into the bedroom,
eyes wet and panicked, like you’d dropped
like you dropped your ring down sink, lost
a treasure to the depths. I knew that look
because I’d worn it myself when I was younger – 
ocean-faced, the look you get
watching someone you love die. 

Your mom, like the saints, is silent right now,
your dad is calling family. I am asking you questions
you don’t know the answers to. You want answers
and you want your mom. So,
we drive away from home, quickly
toward uncertainty. Watching you cry
the whole way – 
something I’ll never forget. You hugged her
with enough force to throw me back in time. 

I am going to relive this with you.

We don’t get enough details. We get dates
and names of doctors. We make dinner
and play board games, and I wonder 
if you’re letting your mom win. A little victory,
a certainty. At night, in the guest room,
you hold me tighter, and whisper in my ear.

You ask
how people sleep
when they learn
death has come closer.

I don’t know
what to tell you – 
death is holding our hands
when we are born.

My words help us cry together, ocean-faced
in a familiar place made strange. We take more time,
we make plans that revolve
around distance and appointments
and each other. I will never not be there. I will feel
the old hollow of my own mom’s absence, new,
every day with you. 

When we leave for home, you’re an anchor,
heavy and steady. You can drive this time. We talk
and sing loudly to the radio. This is us screaming
into the abyss together. We cross the threshold
like we did when we got back from our elopement. 

In the bedroom, I see you
cup your breasts. Even as I step barefooted behind you
I know you are ocean-faced again. I know the worry
because I have carried it for years. In my hands
I hold yours, pull them slowly away from questions
we can’t answer yet. I pull your hands toward me,
toward certainty. I am going to relive this with you.


"ROCK, HUNTING"

Wet stone,
cold on the lake shore, edged and coarse. 

The stone is my body 
in the bed of a new lover – 
the stone waits. Between the soft machine of your tongue
and the grit of your teeth.

What does it mean
to tumble? Silent direction in the arch of a spine,
in the loss of time, the waves,
the stripping of exterior
down to bare
nerve.

Wet stone,
naked, a glistening wound, constellation of scars – 
navigation implies destination,
and a desire to be there.


"PILLAR"

I remember when the church was a castle,
the glow of the stained glass, broken faces,
all the crowns floating softly
somewhere above. Holograms. The velvet and the tile,
somewhere between
a bedroom and a music hall.

The stairs that ascended were hidden
behind too many doors – 
no white light just dust,
a spiral of warped boards,
and where the ceiling opened, a bell
in the shape of a breast, blocking out the sky.

A steeple is a pillar
of sound and shadow. Brick and marble.
The remnant trunk of a German pine tree in a forest 
full of lost people. This loft is the belly of the sylph,
a heaven where all we do is wait
for a small bite of apple.

Sky is sweet, 
so far from the fire and salt. Looking back
a rose grows in the mortar, impossible, sharp –
the stronghold of childhood. Ruins. 

Who would sacrifice me on this altar?
Here I am. An offering of nerve.


"THE DINER ISN’T A CHURCH"

Friends, playing cards at the table,
all the refills are empty, 	we are empty
and this is theater, 
slick, spilled in the night, 	every night
a stage of stained carpet and a salad bar,
a shine on the seats from unmoving people – 
it’s just a shift. 

I have a pirate crush on our waitress
who smells like cigarettes and Secret deodorant,
who has sleeves of tattoos and chewed nails, a ring
on every finger. I see the spread of her hand
beneath the tray. Her smile is white like florescent lights
and speaks of lost treasure, and her shoes say she walks 
everywhere, her legs say she walks everywhere. 

I put all the paper rings on the edge of the table, 
	 an altar, 
	 an offering, 
	 a number on a napkin
laid carefully over the leftover chicken strips,
laid carefully. Uno,
someone says – my cards, two, are blue,
bent at the corners. The game is over. Filthy habit.

Outside the air is clear, and I see the waitress
taking out the trash: 
the dumpster is covered in grease, and I want to be
				          covered in her tattoos
but I walk away, and hope she cleans the table herself – 
but my phone never rings, we never vibrate,
we just keep praying to the management
for something different.


"TOURING"

I think about prison and 
I think about celebrity, 
how so many have freedom stolen and 
others casually give it away – 
how do you trade home for strange tables? 
How do you give up navigation 
for cabs on strange streets? 
How do you surrender life, 
not to love, but strangers 
in a strange world?


"UNDER THE STAINED GLASS EYES OF MARY"

Echo. Sound off the tile 
in the high-school stairwell 
almost swallowed her voice. 
She said my name. My name. She said 
God was having a movie night at the Lutheran Church. 
I should come. I should come. 

I don’t remember the movie, 
but I remember her sideways on a beanbag chair, 
curve in curve. After, I remember how we sat on the tan stone stairs. 
The stairs. We sat and she found a map 
to that place in my mouth from where I spoke. I spoke.
Invitation. Invocation. Incantation. 

I could see my words in her eyes, 
the spring sun in the blush of her skin. Her skin, 
warm hands on a cool day wrapped around mine, 
filled with breath. Watermelon chapstick. Chapstick.
She leaned in, and the world disappeared in the halo of her hair – 
she kissed me. Kissed me in the sight of God.

My smile was metal and rubber bands,
but for the first time there was absolutely no shame. No shame.


"THE BOX WAS BURIED ON A T-ROAD"

I remember the summer
we jumped off the roof
into the hot tub. It started
with a letter. She sent me 
Goethe by mail, asking to stay.

She drove three hours
before I even had an answer
written. In black 
mascara running down her face.
Wet sunflowers on her yellow shirt.

Her cheeks were a map,
a legend she told her parents,
the key to unlock rage. 
She said, “There’s so much red – 
I think hell has always been here.”

We held each other,
shaking in the driveway, trembling,
knowing tears. Grief. Medicine. Tears are
symbols of regret, sadness, pity.
Faustian emotions. Ending emotions.
 
I’d never sold my soul before,
but the gravel called. Remember,
in summer, a deal sounds like the Top 40.  
How do you choose a crossroads 
when everything intersects?

She deserved to be happy,
that was my philosophy then,
we all did. We believed. There was no demon, 
just a pitchfork in a far field,
just a stolen bottle of butterscotch schnapps.

She smiled, and the moon smiled
a thin grin, thousands of miles away.
The corner of her mouth, a small twitch,
her hand and mine on the bottle. She said,
“I wish I could see the ocean.”

We stood on the shingles,
staring at the light beneath the whirlpools.
“Thank you”, she said. We jumped together.  
I remember the cascade from our cannonball.
She laughed, like a child. She glittered.


"REDUCING DEPTH TO ZERO"

Dance is vector.

Depth, the distance
between two people, shifts as bodies add bodies.

She is dancing, and her body says bodies belong together. 
Movement doesn’t happen in a single direction, 
it is not isolated – the bass pumps, and she is behind me,
all arms, all hands. Follow me. Follow me. Hips.

Music is gasoline, the mirrorball a lit match. She rolls
with the kick drum, and I fall into her like a bed.

Thump and rattle. This unity is an anthem,
and we are now – in this dark room 
full of breath and punch and damp clothes – 
alone.

She adds me.


"NEW GROWTH"

In the woods I am
a tree. A cemetery, a church
taking offerings of breath – tired bodies
inside me. Birds
in my lungs. Breath between
laughter and sigh.

I am here to be worshiped
but I see 
the hunting knife, in your mouth
the drill and spile. On your knees
you fill me
with holes – I am emptied. 

New growth
is not enough to live. 
I am always falling
out. No autumn. No sleep.
Where can I go
with roots so deep?


"BETWEEN POINTS ON A PLANE"

Somewhere in the night the aurora fills my eyes – 
this is north right? The shine and the cold
and the caribou. I am part of this
migration in the eventide, going 

somewhere else. I remember the sun,
how it’s not like the pins of light,
distant, on the dark blanket.
There used to be warmth

somewhere. A place with landmarks,
topography, legends. I can count
my ribs, needles discovering orientation.
Here I am a compass.

Can you find direction in a dream? 


"TWIN PEAKS LOVE SONG"

I saw you.
I saw you.
I saw you.

I remember now the music playing
at the bar. You were a spy, you were sex
when you danced, three songs, all curves
when you cried. You were obsession
in the mornings. I could tell
how empty you were
by how much coffee you drank. It was dark
when we braided our legs, soft
music played through 
the window like a radio – 
leitmotifs that left me frayed
until the light poured in.

I don’t know what force swallowed
your spirit in the night –  
I couldn’t kiss you
when you became a rag doll. 
Couldn’t fix you – I moved on and drank
more coffee. Honeyed.

Where was I now?


"A LOG IS JUST PAPER BEFORE IT’S MADE"

What’s it like to have half each foot
in the grave of creation?

What terrors and marvels
pass through your thin frame,
nutrients in the root maze,
spray from the waterfall?

Receptive skin and that damned stick
that never quite fit in your hand.

The bark is dark, but the core is light – 
I’ve learned now
you were a miracle, give me a map
to where your tree grows.


"I FEEL MY BODY COULD GROW A FOREST"

She takes a picture on my phone -
me at the lake, her on the other side. From here
she is an arm's length away. My shadow of my arm 
stretches over the grains of sand, 
and I think about my skin. 

I think how there is nothing in my pocket
but dust. Not enough motes to count
for every secret I already carry, all this dead skin
and I don't know how to show it to anyone.

She is in her bikini. She is ready for this. She is
all the water. I am the driest person I know.

I stand on the shore, wanting to tell her
I like the picture, she makes me feel beautiful.

When she yells for me to get in the water, I get in,
and for a moment we are part of the same place,
I can feel how the molecules slide and wrap us together,
a sheet in the wind, a slick knot, a sloppy braid. I watch
the sunburn slide off her shoulders. 
I know how that feels.

I ask her if she's busy tomorrow, and she is,
so I let her go, and I blow away. At night
I see the picture on my phone, and I plan to call her.

I still plan to call her. I have so much to share
when my tongue is wet enough. 


"I AM ALSO MADE OF STEEL GIRDERS AND CONCRETE"

Mom talks to me about how bridges connect 
places that are separated from each other.

But when she speaks about Boğaziçi Köprüsü
I can only see the separation, built on top

of separation. It's been about war and death
since the first architect. Hafızam yok.

She's a bridge I want to burn some days,
talk about home as if it's a place

you can never return. In my bed at night,
when I am safe, I dream of telling her

Amsterdam and Istanbul have the same sun:
thuis is een plek die je nooit kunt verlaten. 


"DIRTY / PRETTY"

that little thrill i get / from watching that scene in dirty dancing /
where baby comes to johnny’s room / after saving penny
from the botched abortion /

that little thrill i get / moves like that move they do /
when they start to dance / that dip-swing /
that swayful mirroring / that shake of baby’s curls

that look almost like mine /

that also look like vivian’s in pretty woman /
after the blonde wig leaves forever / releasing hair
that’s some kind of red jungle / spreading and spreading /
a reforestation of herself / against a backdrop of ’80s hits and crones in pearls /

that little thrill i get at her hyena laugh /
in the iconic scene where edward snaps the lid shut
on the quarter-million-dollar necklace /

and suddenly she is a beacon in the hotel lobby /
which isn’t new when you remember the scene /
where they kick her from the dress shop in beverly hills /

just like it isn’t new that
i hear her hyena laugh in mine /
her beacon in mine /

and then i think of how i learned / that i am autistic
from old parenting books on my mom’s shelf /

and how i’m really not like these gals /
whose lovers are played by patrick swayze and richard gere /
who are beacons partly because they’re in love /
and know how to say so

and i think comparatively of how i used to cry /
just telling the bookshelf story to my own lovers /
as if they all knew before i did /
obvious like the laugh / or the curls /

obvious like a watermark
running down the center of me /
well meaning but awkward in shape /
awkward in motion /

how it jerks in parallel to our lover’s body /
endlessly unsure of the steps /

the watermark asks / how to feel safe in the sway and dip and shake /
how to live well under the blanket of strange, tender music /
how to dance the right way in love /

i don’t know how to answer all that /
but i always go back to that scene / to that little thrill i get /
from watching johnny and baby get together /
while the man on the radio asks / if i feel like crying /

and i answer as if i’m there with all of them / i say yeah, man /
but first we need to rewind / give me that mirror one more time /

so i can remember how somebody / wanted to make a movie
about strange women in love / about beacons / shining /
always unwillingly, radiantly shining /

how somebody made these gals / these movies /
in my image /


"HONNE ON YOUTUBE"

Would you like it if I told you
I imagine you, pretty
much any time I watched a kiss
on a TV show or even a commercial, 
or watching tourist couples
high on each other. I keep thinking
it might freak you out a little
that while I'm the main character
in every book I read,
you're the love interest,
even if it's only headcannon.

Someday, if I'm brave 
as some Chosen One, I might 
touch your hand in a way that isn't
painting your nails 
when your fingers shake, might
tell you about even Mom and Dad
still kiss, and how 
that could kind of be us. Maybe,
if we had some wine
I would even show you this poem.


"YOUR NICKNAME"

We're standing silent on paddleboards
and I can see your sweat. I wonder
if you can see mine, the effort it takes
to just stand and not fall in. The water
is sparkling, and so are you. 

I know, underneath, 
the stones and their weight, discarded
trash. But also, lost rings,
gardens and pearls, things forgotten
or not discovered, yet.

But we aren't exploring today.
I wish we were. Finding
new ways to enjoy each other's company.
I tell you I'm too hot, and disappear,
and wonder if you follow 
because you want me, 
or if you just need to cool down, too.

When we pull our boards and bodies
to the shore, we're both sparkling,
water diamonds, sand glitter. I want 
to tell you everything 
I've wondered today, but instead
just ask if you want to grab
a bite to eat before going home.


"YOU TALK OF GREEN I TALK OF DEATH"

The farms and dikes 
and the hands that made them
were all adopted for war.

If you build the walls high enough,
the water can't get in. Unless you want it. 
Sounds like troop movements, 
sounds like a trap. Fact:
most of the land we live on
has some blood in it, scabs from battles,
polders, solid with need. The need 
for more to touch 
and less to remember.

But bogs border everything,
and at the bottom you'll find seagrass
growing again. Covered stones, waiting
for the pump and the plow and, always,
more blood.


"LAKEDEEP"

The lake holds my hand when I go to it. Water knows
I am not a tourist. I echo across the waves -
I don't belong. I know the story
about how teeth were planted in the ground
against its will. How the inlet lodged in its throat,
even in the driest season. The waves and flow
keep carving my toungue like good engineers keep building
islands in the shallowest depths. It was never meant to be 
here for so long, but people depend on it, now. Someday
it will evaporate completely, or 
it will eat the shoreline, the city. Free itself.


"GENETIC TRANSLATION"

I process everything my mother says 
three times. I try to ask her 
about the future.

Her mouth is a crescent, cutting me off
telling me boşver. But I can't. I think 
about Elsa and the ice and the mountain,
I think of a castle above this castle
I already have. This is the dream 
in English. In Dutch it's laat het gaan,
and I think about school, and the yard,
and people I thought were friends
telling me pride isn't worth a fistfight.

But at home, I think in Turkish
first. I think about how I think about
my mother's words. How the cycle starts
and ends with me loving her more 
than she loves me. I'm too tired to push
the point. I choke, my own mouth,
crescent enough, walking away but always
telling her seni seviyorum.  


"NAUTIULS CUP"

We drink ocean’s meat from silver shells
and sunshine from the sea
Nacre, lacre, gold and glass
melt in my throat –
odd that snow doesn’t

We drink
round and round to the slimming center

You outdoing me once more, I remember
you, legs braced straight against the world,
lips pressed against the sky
as the aurora fell in your mouth

Something you tried was your poison
I don’t know which or I would try it myself

(myself in museums looking at a Lalique
perfume bottle empty, through a pane of our older tastes,
it would be nothing for me to swallow the divider whole
but I only look. I can smell
sandalwood musk and rose oil greasing my tongue)

You, rinsing memory’s river from fistfuls
of soil into my mouth
You spitting wind and ink

(myself at a tarot reading
told to watch out for the sister of cups
years too late to avoid you
or protect you)

The pthalos all taste like grays now
the verdants too
but sometimes, lips pressed against the river
I can still taste your joy


"ACROSS THE ANVIL AND BURNING"

Come now, sit. There,
where the iron meets the shallow ground.
Stretch
your skin over the cinders, lick up the ash until
you are grey and smeared with a thousand deceased flames.

Now, are you ready, my girl? Oh
you are ready.
Let me temper you in this forge
pour heat into you, melt
under my blows and my gaze and the
workings of my fingers.

I would smoke you
salt you
render you.
Let the warmth rise til your sweat is slick and
sizzling down your back
between your thighs.

I would sear you with my fingerprints,
and study how the ash marks change as you
writhe.
You will writhe.

When you are complete
face up among the coals and heaving
I will slip sugar pieces and chips of ruby
grapefruit between your flushed lips.
I will cool your gullet with iced wine
bathe you in cherries and break
shards of sandalwood against your skin
so its scent bubbles and unfurls,
so I can taste the holiness in the air.

My girl, my love, you are now so sharp
you split
my tongue.


"BLUEPRINT"

The poem I want to build needs a vestibule
Inviting all who wish to be bidden
Welcome: an ample parallelogram
With a skylight open to a patch of stars.

Horses, of course there will be horses
Gathering in darkness
Under those stars in a field of grass
Extending far enough for an eye to grasp

Bounty uncontainable. A passageway
Will lead to a loft for the hay
And a wing to accommodate the rain.
Where will I store a roomful of ash?

In a crypt in the cellar,
Adjoining vaulted chambers of seed
Saved from flowers buried
In pockets in a dream. The attic

Is for scores of unheard music,
Notes from expired currencies, toys,
Diplomas, film reels, a shoebox of shells,
Centuries of things to be sorted later

(Albums, letters, keys, locks of hair),
Sealed to keep the past from taking over.
Essential to the structure is an atrium
Where a thought on its own may rise,

And every storey shall include
Corners tempting a child to hide.
What the garden grows, a resident,
However transient, may decide, 

Provided some hydrangeas recollect
Slow-dissolving cumuli
And along a gate unlatched for passersby
Lobelias spill indigo.

Above all, the plan will correspond
With the terrain beyond the boundary,
Features of topography the print alone
Won’t show (a void 

Is a wilderness sustained
By the margin). To that end,
The design makes sure a visitor
Exiting any door must meander,

Following light as it falls across
Nameless shades in a palette of moss
On a path sown with conifer needles until
Stumbling into a clearing

Before a precipice, whose lip
Offers access to
Water on water pouring through
A stone vestibule—
Here, I’m at a loss,

Without a line to plumb the measure of bliss.
But I know this: when I step outside
There’s a space within reach
No quadrant can divine or divide.


"DISSIMULATION WITH BIRDS"

i. Starling

Black husk, shimmered in oil come midnight.
Dreams of leaving emerge hard as bells
when I wake alone and mouth the word alone
only to glimpse mirror’s sharpened beak at my back.

ii. Cardinal

Come day, everything I hide is a feast
for you, picnicking in late summer’s green.
If I were to wallflower yet again
would you promise never to search for me?

iii. Sparrow

On the Euro rail all the trees were the same
dull bread, and I, ravenous as the scripture.
Tamed on the crowded streets of Prague,
I forgot my name means anything.

iv. Finch

Calling you all, I lost the point of color,
colliding in the monsoon of our bed, pecking
at random interactions misidentified
as something other than this fleeting.

v. Heron

Still, the stillness wrecks me. Balancing
these wings of memories, the labor I leave
till dawn is a sharp slit of the knife’s evening
before I even think to move from the cutting.


"ALL DEAD THINGS SHALL COME TO ME"

They wash out on my shore each night
Trinkets and glass, ivory masks
Heart-shaped lockets, diaries, maps
Smashed toys and silver, shiny stones
Beads, bottles, buttons, buttercups, bones
Of whales, sometimes, and water dragons’ spines

Sometimes     it’s the placenta of a new-born star
Sometimes     I trip on angel wings at dawn
Almost brand new, waiting for someone to
Adjust the straps and put them on

Talent, I have, that’s what they said
To find the life in what is dead

People are begging at my door, you see
To craft them harps of former lovers’ hair
They hand me fragments of the air — soul pottery
To bandage hearts that I repair

I rummage among seashells, teacups, cutlery
Metallic parts and cogs. I am
An artisan of sorts, I guess
Bee-keeper, ferryman
A gardener of graveyard gods
I stitch together wood and foam
Porcelain dreams, cicada husks
Heart-shaped keys and bird-song dusks

All dead things shall come to me
To tinker them to life, to undo mistake
A broken clock, uprooted tree
I make, I make, I make

A golden ribcage, pewter bee
Still wishing what I cannot take         —        I  break

And all dead things shall come to me
Still haven’t found what died in me
Still haven’t found what died in me


"THE LARK, THE PEAT, THE STAR, OUR TIME"

It was the year of no summer,
when it hid under banks of rain, ducked
behind fog, dashed across the road
in front of us, rolled under a car and out
the other side, its face a flash in a side mirror,
flirting for our notice, as though a test
of our worthiness. We weren’t. Worthy that is.
We gave up on it, threw ourselves on autumn’s
mercies, deciding the metallic hint of frost was best.
And a lark flashed a needle across the west.

We froze in place. It was the sign we needed:
a sunrise bird, sewing the sky, sowing winter
like a seed in our hearts where it might sprout
and flourish, thicken and keep us chilled
through all the long and glorious nights.
We weren’t heroes, we were cheats:
we thought we were big enough to revel in it.
We thought we were brave and brazen.
We weren’t. We huddled in our solstice retreats
And we spread a thousand peats

to warm our hearts. And they did. We admitted it.
So spring took pity on us. Raised its head above
our bleak horizon. Thawed playgrounds into blossoming.
Warmed us into fields worth plowing, planting,
all the works of hope, made us truly brave.
Rained and shone into us. Our courages are
more humble now, but no less than the first leaf
tenderly unfurling, spreading its fingers to reach
the first glinting bar of summer sun, just that far
Between one summer star

and the next, the next, and the next, how we
learned to flourish, to abound, to be unbound,
to stop counting each minute and to hold our hands
out to the sun, letting it dry and freckle our skins.
Allowing ourselves touch the minutes like ball bearings
we could let fall one by one, so we could enter
each day and leave it tasted, noted, changed
by our passage. Enjoy that our explorations were
no longer those of children, time was our mentor
And the black chaos of fire at the earth’s centre.


"MAYBE THE FORESTS OF THE MOON BURNED, LONG AGO"

My screen glows brighter than the window – 
I’m trying to fill out applications
to a future I’m unsure exists. I am dreaming
about water on Europa. I am life 
orbiting Jupiter. Mom is on her phone, 
speaking about fire, in a language from the past.

When her voice stops it changes
from fear to footfalls, 
as she walks to my room. I know
she can’t believe in the future. So I tab
to a video, a screen that looks like I’m happy
in these walls that have become cage and grave.

She tells me I should be reading news
I already know. She shows me pictures
of dead fields, dead forests, grey ash
between red and drying green. I think
how much it looks like the moon I’ve seen 
in textbooks. The dead one, so close to home.

I tell her how sad the pictures make me,
but not why. She whispers how sad she is,
how I give her hope, and I believe her. I hug her, 
say goodnight, but don’t let my head hit the pillow. 
Instead I tab back to the future and think 
about how I can’t carry her life. Can barely carry mine.


"STILL SLEEPING AT THE FOOT OF MY BED"

Streaming too many shows about ghost hunting,
wishing I had the equipment. I’d sit and listen to static
with you. I’d leave the recorder running all day,
all night. Would you hang out in my room
and whisper one word answers to questions
I don’t know how to ask? Would you tell me
your voice is so quiet because there’s peace
and you’re not willing to disturb yourself? I get it – 
but what would it hurt to laugh
when I tell myself a joke? And I could play it back
later, and know I’ve still got what it takes
to make you smile 
in that way that’s not suitable for TV. I’d kill 
to know the knocks I hear sometimes are just you
dancing with some new friends 
you’ll introduce me to with an awkward story
when I cross the water in a few decades.


"WHAT I WANT IN THE DARK"

Somedays, I pray for a black swan, a catastrophe, something 
to send us to a world filled with the skeletons of industry,
no glows electric left. No, I pray for light that exists 
only in flickering flames, candles, oil lamps. I pray for light, 
fragile like the world it lives in. Of course I want this 
for myself. I want to meet the dead again, I want to keep time 
by the moon, by how often I howl, by the lapping of the waves,
by how much more blood there is in bodies than the dirt. I can imagine, 
some nights, what a dead world would be like. How like a ghost 
it would echo itself quietly into eternity. In that place 
where there are no distractions, I could focus on you. Maybe
I could even understand the language of goosebumps on my skin,
and why I feel your breath better with the lights out.


"I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS"

I know you’re there, so I’m talking to you,
even though I know
you have no breath left to give me. I need
to have some answers in advance, 
I need to ask – what do you do, ghost, 
what do you do when you want 
to be remembered, when you want love
but you can’t go home? Do you get angry? 
Is that why the mirror cracks? Is it a map
across the void? If only you could read it,
if only you could travel, unanchor, if only 
you could do anything other than remember 
a place, so far away, and break. 


"MONSTER LOVE"

You’re going to be surprised
when you find out how I’m stitched together – 
all coffee and pomegranate juice
inside my mother’s record sleeves, sewn
with the innards of cassettes. I’m a jewel case,
I’m an amalgamation
of other people’s history. I didn’t ask to breathe
the salt air. I didn’t ask for lighthouses and fire,
I just exist here. Can you teach me
what it’s like to be someone else? Anywhere else
is better. I could be better with you, I could be
almost human. I’m choking out words
my grandparents knew by heart, begging
you to save me.


"THE COLOR I TAKE"

All day the green had soaked me, leaf-dappled pollen-dipped, sweet grass and lawn-clippings, clover and plantain, the wrinkled world fresh in its unfurling pouring everything down and dripping my back. Love in its mist, a yellow vined up my fingertips and fruited at my shoulders and some sky such a pulsing pressing blue the air couldn’t stand between us. Everything was merge and float, light running maniac across the retina. All the things that life has stained me by and with, drab parking lots and laundromats, pale lost tickets, the grey scrubbing daily, all this pushed to the raw edges of the universe so that I might be soaked and seeped in color. And there the shore absorbing sea and the green absorbing blue what does it know about how a mountain insists or how everything must learn to bear its shadow. Midnight-blue bleeds to black, a canyon down which the last of the sun is poured, orange as pure egg yolk.


"THE FINELY GROOVED SURFACE OF THE SEA"

I had a phonograph once and just one record. It was a very important record. Nobody liked to listen to it except me. It was a shark.

“Listen to this,” I’d say to my friends. I’d put the record on and turn the crank. Out of the horn would come the wet crack and silence of a shark being harpooned. It was followed by a riotous cheer, the zip of the cross-cut saw, the wet flopping of the headless shark, and the helpless struggle suddenly stopping.

“Turn it off,” they’d say. “Nobody wants to hear that.” Or, “We can’t dance to that.”

They didn’t understand. I didn’t want them to dance. I wanted them to listen. Instead, they left and slammed the door.

The recording continued, seemingly forgotten, for some time—sailors shouting, the sound of wooden kegs being cracked, ale sloshing on the deck, laughter, singing. The shark was not in any of this, not from the beginning.
The sounds ended abruptly, much like the shark, but before the end, there were a few minutes of silence, like everyone had gone to bed. All you could hear was the ocean and the sound of the needle scratching the surface.


"TIGHT SLEEP"

Bedtime is a ritual. I am a sacrifice.

I’ll spend hours at night reconciling
pieces of myself to my body – the dust
to my skin, the blood to my bone, 
the breath to my ancestors. The spirits
do nothing to stop the terror
when I close my eyes, too many
shared memories, too many ghosts
wishing not my death but to live in me,
to live. It’s not an explosion, it’s hands
in the mouth, in the throat, 
searching for corners of me 
unoccupied. They fill me, a flood
like swallowing the bedsheets, 
the air inside me can’t escape; caught
beneath the weight of history
and the linen closet, it changes 
weight, a settling poison, 
the sharp arrow of a clenched heart, 
more in common with ash than angels.

I would give anything to wake up 
not tangled, not wet and wrapped
in expectations. I would give anything
to wake up alone.


"INK-LIGHT"

We move within the snow-chromed world: Like-animal. Like-deer. An alphabet. Along a street white as lamplight into the winter, walking—: like language, a new text. I touch her with the eyes of my skin.

The way I read any beloved—: from the ramus of the left jaw down to the cuneiform of the right foot. She isn’t so much what she is—: and becomes herself only when added to the space where she isn’t. What is touch—: not the touch not the hand but the white heat it floats through.

I count her my desires, mark her—: hoofprints across the frozen page. Four strokes of dusk. Carbon black, Lamp black, Bone black, Hide glue—: I am the alchemist of ink. She answers me, Quicksilver,

and the noise of her boots upon the snow is the weight of a night bird bending the meteor-blue branch fruiting white flames of cotton. Each of her steps, an allograph—: bird, flexed limb, perfect line of vertebrae, the glyph of my pelvis.

When I put my teeth to her wrist, the world goes everywhere white. Not sound but the dizzying nautilus of what is both the palm and the ear. I invented her hand in this texture—: a grapheme.

In me, a feeling—: white blossom with a red-sided icosahedron inside the velveteen car of a gold train vibrating the violet tunnel of my throat on its way to a dimmed station in my chest—: twenty seats of desire, and I am sitting in each one.

I burn on the silver sparks of her breath moving out of her body. The miracle. No. The power and the glory glory glory of her—: she breathes. Out—: Out—: twenty red seats of desire, I break every one. A series of waves against hammer anvil stirrup—: a vibration of light I can hold with my mouth.


"10:90"

We pour shampoo into Norah’s hot tub,
well, not her hot tub, her parents’ hot tub,
but we’re the ones using it, and we want
bubbles. It takes a lot 
to overcome the chemical treatments,
but eventually there are bubbles spilling out – 
a glass of beer with too much head, 
a popped champagne bottle 
with the right amount of happiness 
behind the cork. We grow white hair. We dress
in translucent wedding gowns and marry
each other. We put on masks. We grow horns.
We laugh. We get tired. Well, 
everyone else gets tired. Me, I listen to giggles
receding like the tide, wet feet
slapping the flagstones a little less 
with each step. The door opens, the door closes.

I am alone in the bubbles. I gather them to me,
I pile them like a penguin making a nest
on a nature documentary. I think,
maybe, I am beneath an iceberg. I am,
proverbially, mostly unknown. I turn the jets off
and watch the bubbles pop themselves, disappearing
into the air. Glaciers are melting, I think, pretty soon 
I will stop being underwater. When I stand,
I am in a wedding dress. The door opens again.

A voice calls my name, tells me to come in. Dance.
 

"PERHAPS THE WORLD ENDS HERE"

The world begins at a kitchen table. No matter what, we must eat to live.

The gifts of earth are brought and prepared, set on the table. So it has been since creation, and it will go on.

We chase chickens or dogs away from it. Babies teethe at the corners. They scrape their knees under it.

It is here that children are given instructions on what it means to be human. We make men at it, we make women.

At this table we gossip, recall enemies and the ghosts of lovers.

Our dreams drink coffee with us as they put their arms around our children. They laugh with us at our poor falling-down selves and as we put ourselves back together once again at the table.

This table has been a house in the rain, an umbrella in the sun.

Wars have begun and ended at this table. It is a place to hide in the shadow of terror. A place to celebrate the terrible victory.

We have given birth on this table, and have prepared our parents for burial here.

At this table we sing with joy, with sorrow. We pray of suffering and remorse. We give thanks.

Perhaps the world will end at the kitchen table, while we are laughing and crying, eating of the last sweet bite.


"AND THE MOON SEES ME"

People take pictures of the moon in the sky,
the supermoons, the many-colored moons, awful blurs
on cell phones, failures to resolve the height, the immensity – 

the lens will never understand distance. I am so low,
flat-backed on the concrete of the balcony, looking up
through wrought iron, gently twisted. The moon is trying

to escape the swell of beastly tides, growing like shadows
in late afternoon. Fingers, invisible, cup the back of her head. Pull.
She pulls away, she gets further, further, but every effort makes her 

tired, so tired. I love her. The moon is trying to escape,
but all the data says she never will. Everyone follows her phases,
never curious about why she is always trying to hide.

I am reaching my arm through the iron bars, stretching my fingers,
but my arm is not long enough. My arm is not long enough,
so I stand up, go inside. Try to imagine her free.


"NOCTURNE WITH DANCERS"

Because heat lightning
sears femurs
along the cloud mass,
these smoky phantoms
which flock like catbirds
darkening then alighting
from the yard’s boughs,
I bring the dog inside
and let him snuggle close.

He curls until his hind legs
rest just below his maw.
They are as white and silky
as the opera gloves
of Degas’ Song of the Dog.

Rains stutter against
the yellowing paspalum
fleshing the highway’s culverts.
These days are measurable
by threads pets gifted us,
too short and course
to be of use.

Strange to think of them.
Strange too to think
Degas’ bodices and basques
spindly as Queen Anne’s Lace
let you understand
the loss of your mother.

These ordinary wonders
do not leave us―
a wolf beside
my unguarded throat,
ragged acacias
above a ball field.

Run-off inundated
a whole diamond last spring.
And once the waters receded,
what remained were muck
and silt, lines of motion
where eddies whirled.

It must have been beautiful,
this ronds de jambe.
How Degas lost himself
painting women
young enough to be girls.

They look lost amidst lacey petals,
delphinium too tired to care
about the artist.

They know he can’t offer
them immortality
only oil on canvas,
pastel on paper,
the wax corpus of a goddess,
nameless dervish.


"THE MARTYR"

i am made into a star
my mortality pressed out of me
like the layers of bitter apples
hemmed into the cider press.
it only takes pressure,
a transfiguration in silence,
to make a diamond out of ashes.

it was not always so.
i remember before.
but the light of the star by the time it reaches you
is long dead.
the daily living killed me by degrees
and anyone who asks should know this:
what happened to me above
was far better than anything i experienced on earth.

somewhere beyond radio contact
the air went stale
and as my eyes went dim the change began:
the ice of space wrapped around me
like the Theotokos’ celestial mantel
as the capsule cracked and moaned.
the void swallowed all mourner’s prayers
but i did not try to say them.

when i agreed to go
slip those surly bonds with my steely certainty
i thought surely
i would touch the face of God
and forget what my own had looked like.
so i called myself Valentina
with all my unfortunate hair and severe mouth,
a new name for my tonsure and profession.
i shut myself into the capsule
and held my breath as the seconds slipped away
the last moments of gravity and its contractions
streaking silver into the heavens
and past them
until i was finally alone.

i wanted the silence.
i wanted the emptiness to make
a hermitage of zero gravity,
become a stylite amongst the stars —
an astronomical anchoress

a soyuz my desert cave
and i to be St Anthony
with all of space as my wilderness,
mechanical failure for my martyr’s beasts,
and within myself find the peace promised
that comes with ending —
nothing but flesh to be devoured
but i was ready for this last and greatest mystery.
saints are by death transformed,
birthed to their universal adoration,
and so was i:

glorified in the highest and peace,
a star at last —
forever lighting the way for the next traveller.
this is the way, the truth, and the life
transfigured: nothing left
but an engine flame beneath my ikon
of steel and glory,
now and forever.


"TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE"

Here’s another duality: there are those who learn
Time travel is possible, and instantly realize their losses,
However overbearing the grief
That has ripped at hidden flesh and still gnaws,

Rat king curled in your throat. These deaths, inextricable
From our lives, which have grown on,
However twisted and scarred. The absence of
Your loved ones will be subsumed

In the sudden possibility, the pain
Releases like an orgasm and acceptance is total
In the moment we reject the undoing.
And then there’s the other kind of people,

Those who would stop at nothing to bring their loved ones back.
The silence means you are asking yourself, now.


"DIACHRONICITY"

in kismet three summers ago you tried to kiss me
but it was the height of inappropriate and I beat 
you to the pulp in an orange juice container

that shock that disbelief that fucking astonished―
afterwards you walked to the market and I
went to the docks to see what the children reeled in

one hundred and six days ago we sat on the floor 
in your childhood bedroom and transferred fragrances
while your mother cooked dinner two floors down

meanwhile


"ALTAR"

Maybe it’s enough to say, in hindsight,
the conditions were right for bleeding there.

Maybe it’s enough to know he swam at night,
climbed jagged rock to offer the required flesh. 

By then, he knew the dream had given all it had,
collapsing, as dreams do, into real seas.

The island took from him, then threw him 
with a wave. And that was June.

Not by chance the blood turned back to water.
No accident that salt burned in the wound.

The idea of July was still too much.


"DELICIOUS FRAGMENT, LEFT PANEL, BACK SIDE"

In the city, I surround myself with sin
at a distance. I think about the old men
who filled their cellars and attics 
with bodies –  I think about Bosch, 
and I think about gluttony and torment, 
empty eyes, how people lust 
with their clothes on, I think 
how hot a dead body might be. In the oven,
there is a cake. When it is done, a bell will ring,
and posing as an angel, I will eat it.


"QUANTUM PHYSICS IN THE GARDEN"

Touch the ground tentatively with the whole palm as if patting the small of a back, or a small back. Scratch at it so the soft hairs fall away. Let grass give way to digging hands I sit watching, not watching. Turn sore-skinned face down, in self-shade from the sun. Hear hard soil pitter-patter like tiny feet landing lightly back onto the box sealed tightly—so tightly that the cat resting on his sky blue cushion inside, below, once and at once short-lived and forever friend, might once again be alive.


"THE INDEX"

In the beginning there was darkness,
then a bunch of other stuff—and lots of people.
Some things were said and loosely interpreted,

or maybe things were not communicated clearly.
Regardless—there has always been an index.
That thing about the meek—how we

shall inherit the earth; that was a promise
made in a treaty at the dawn of time
agreed upon in primordial darkness                

and documented in the spiritual record.
The nature of the agreement was thus:
The world will seemingly be pushed past capacity.

A new planet will be “discovered” 31 light-years away.   
Space travel will advance rapidly,
making the journey feasible. The ice sheets will melt.

Things will get ugly. The only way to leave
will be to buy a ticket. Tickets will be priced at exactly
the amount that can be accrued

by abandoning basic humanity.
The index will show how you came by your fortune:            
If you murdered, trafficked or exploited the vulnerable,

stole, embezzled, poisoned, cheated, swindled,
or otherwise subdued nature to come by wealth
great enough to afford passage to the new earth;

if your ancestors did these things and you’ve done nothing
to benefit from their crimes yet do nothing to atone
through returning inherited wealth to the greater good

you shall be granted passage. It was agreed.
The meek shall stay, the powerful shall leave.
And it all shall start again.

The meek shall inherit the earth,
and what shall we do with it,
but set about putting aside our meekness?


"CHEMISTRY NOTES ON ATTACTIVE FORCES"

'Tangle' is a seductress
way of wording it.
It's more like a crash. Look
at the hunter-song, writing
with her hands, crooning about a tangle
of limbs, bodies, and ankles.
The reality: knock our bones together 
until they crash into each other
with all the fundamental forces.
Bound in all the ways we can.
A room is a thing that holds
things. This is much like a person.
A room is also a locus of activity, again,
much like a person. There's an orbital
around your head, static shock halo hair,
where I might exist if I'm not observed.
Hold me here and I'll dance circles 
around your heart. I pass through you 
without touching at all, and
when I falter I make light.
I'd like to stay here if I can. I'd like that.
Once, breath
loved a spark so much
she drew herself inward
until spark tore through her.
This is how fire was born,
and her children alight in our blood
to make us hot and alive.
Once, wet loved herself so much
she clung to her body and wept.
This is how fog on the window was born,
why rain is so cold and close,
and how the pondskaters dance.
This is the same way they'll sing about us; 
our old magic bound in the bones
of a world written in things
wanting to be close.


"AFTER THE PARTY"

I am with another girl inside a peach,
ignoring what has come before. Every kiss
brings a little decay, a little new growth.

The fire is coming in the next scene. We’ve seen
this movie before. But we are in a peach, floating
in the lake. Water clings to the finest hairs,
and we are safe.

We watch the fish swallow each other
like a cartoon. Bigger and bigger. They’ll feed
on the bottom. Even the ducks couldn’t save them.

In the stone, they can mistake us
for those already dead. We’ll be passed
right over. 

The pleasure domes might fall
into the sprawling city of flame, the demons
will continue the party. We’ll walk out
of the stone, like a closet, or Christ.


"ANCHORITE"

What is the difference 
between a saint
and a hermit? You cannot say belief – 
imagine hands purpled
with age, scarred by fire, nailbeds
full of sand and flood. And alive. How
would anyone live inside the earth
and not know a higher power? 


"SELF IMPROVEMENT"

in spring i’ll unfurl new growth |
exercise | learn an instrument | achieve life goals | spread my twenty-foot tentacles |
wait | what? | oh my god | why do i have tentacles |
is this | self-actualization?

i am | rolling with it | i guess in spring |
i am a squid with large moonglow eyes | and a murderous beak |
i guess in spring | i live in the abyss | with my squiddy brethren and sistren |
i guess in spring | my blood has quickened | also, it’s blue, and
copper-based | i am a little freaked out but i did say i wanted | a change

alright squids and girls | it’s spring |
and i will eat so many fish | yes | raw |
i will duel the sperm whales of the deep | i will rise at night like a spark of silver fire |
is it | the solstice already? i hadn’t noticed | i’m sorry,
but i am too busy squidding around | to have resolutions this year.


"DONATING SWANS"

Mary wants a bird. What kind? The whole Old Testament
explains the filth of the white feathers, the long neck,
the tender breast. What could be a better symbol,
what could make a better sacrifice, to our woodcarved idol?

Let’s give her the blood, and each other the honor. Let’s
go hunting. We can sing songs and write poems
and make friends who will tell us our swans are fine birds,
mean and graceful. Mary would love them very much.


"A GREAT DAY OF MISERY"

You’re all down here screaming,
naked, tongues laid bare. This whole world
is the Tower of Babel,
and heaven is unattainable. Who can climb
a rainbow like this? The angels are riding
with God, like Carebears ind a cloud car,
the bodies are buried under every footstep,
and there you are, still 
just wanting to be seen. How is it mad
to be strong, to know, to rebel? I pray
to the saints who are not my mother’s
for some peace. Everyone is screaming
and nobody hears me, because 
no one speaks plainly, 
especially to me. How on earth 
can God hear my prayers
over all this noise, his radio turned up? 


"ANTHROPOCENE PASTORAL"

In the beginning, the ending was beautiful.
Early spring everywhere, the trees furred
pink and white, lawns the sharp green
that meant new. The sky so blue it looked
manufactured. Robins. We’d heard
the cherry blossoms wouldn't blossom
this year, but what was one epic blooming
when even the desert was an explosion
of verbena? When bobcats slinked through
primroses. When coyotes slept deep in orange
poppies. One New Year’s Day we woke
to daffodils, wisteria, onion grass wafting
through the open windows. Near the end,
we were eyeletted. We were cottoned.
We were sundressed and barefoot. At least
it’s starting gentle, we said. An absurd comfort,
we knew, a placebo. But we were built like that.
Built to say at least. Built to reach for the heat
of skin on skin even when we were already hot,
built to love the purpling desert in the twilight,
built to marvel over the pink bursting dogwoods,
to hold tight to every pleasure even as we
rocked together toward the graying, even as
we held each other, warmth to warmth,
and said sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry while petals
sifted softly to the ground all around us.


"A SONG ON THE END OF THE WORLD"

On the day the world ends
A bee circles a clover,
A fisherman mends a glimmering net.
Happy porpoises jump in the sea,
By the rainspout young sparrows are playing
And the snake is gold-skinned as it should always be.

On the day the world ends
Women walk through the fields under their umbrellas,
A drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn,
Vegetable peddlers shout in the street
And a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island,
The voice of a violin lasts in the air
And leads into a starry night.

And those who expected lightning and thunder
Are disappointed.
And those who expected signs and archangels' trumps
Do not believe it is happening now.
As long as the sun and the moon are above,
As long as the bumblebee visits a rose,
As long as rosy infants are born
No one believes it is happening now.

Only a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet
Yet is not a prophet, for he's much too busy,
Repeats while he binds his tomatoes:
No other end of the world will there be,
No other end of the world will there be.


"MY RELATIONSHIP WITH WATER"

Distasteful, tongue numbing—
legs stretched long, my body naked, a cove
where the small of my back should be
in a tub with depleting water levels.
This is filth. I’m cutting my fingernails,
crescent moons floating on the surface
of my bath water momentarily
acting like rose petals,
then sinking.
Let the water go
watch what I’ve done follow the current.
Pieces of me circle the drain
suddenly the tub is empty
my nakedness strange,
but my body immovable.
I have obligations,
ability,
everything (add emphasis)
yet nothing will move me—
not even flowers.

Are there gladiolas in your life?
Are they on your catch-all dining room table
near unopened mail, lost car keys,
the indentation of a misfired round?
There’s a poem in a gladiola’s long death dying one
bloom at a time.
Someone else’s poem,
that which doesn’t serve as an extended metaphor
for my failures
remains another person’s problem.

I’ll again pull flowers to pieces when mold
stops growing from the crossed faces
of screws stuffed into fiberglass at eye level.
Call the water back with my toes on the tap.
No one is coming home, I remember.


"CONSIDER ME FERAL"

Hold me while I scream
in church. Burn me,
cast every wine-dark stone.
I am no longer afraid to dye
my clothes in men’s blood
& suck on stained fingers.

Your worship is an inverted deer—
ribs splintered, bones splayed
like thighs scraping hips,
antlers weeping blood.
I scrape my soft parts
out & bury them.

Kiss me like flames
to a heretic. I bear witch-blood
& I will embrace
it. I’ve mixed holy water
into my lip balm—our next kiss
is the last. Consider me feral.


"LIGHTBULBS"

Pushing my soles down onto
broken light bulbs.
Fuck eggshells,

they’re not fragile
or satisfying enough for this
dance that I perform for you.

My wink is an all-knowing one
as I shimmy,
breaking myself like whitewater

against your hip,
reassembling as grit-teethed mercury.

Enduring while tying cherry stalks with my tongue.


"ENDTIME"

Why cannot the ear be closed to its own destruction?
—William Blake

Won’t come alive ever yet or again? In the mind of Endtime it looks like this: shell, volute, Tabriz, eddies, and tides. Flowers wilt. When you wake, observe the unmitigated trials and tribulations of these tossed things, random it seems. But in the endtime, less personhood more ransom. Radical sleep in the Endtime, there is no end of sleep. Multiplying the stars was never easy in Endtime, doing it by themselves, obstinate stars. Self-repairing and learning on the job. Write reports, sniff out plagiarism, fly your planes with a computer. Drones inhabit the Endtime lore, how many kills. In Endtime things go static. Then still. Switch off “solace.” Would you kill another literary form? a ransom note perhaps, saying again: The dead always will be saying too many of us! Then carry the corpses around. In the mind of the Endtime no substitutes but if you care to try your hand you may gamble all you have to offer and what would that be. A mole might do for you, a burrowing animal “thing” might do, biding time might do for a time, a night perhaps you have for rhetoric, before you are released at dawn. Recant, reflect, review, reach out. We have met the enemy and it is the psychotic karmic flow of our blowback. Privileged community survives a raging flood. Maybe. You keep churning and there’s an echo in the world. In the Endtime no need of explanation. Need stronger better experienced cop? He’s a baby. In the Endtime there are theories of dysfunction, delicate wheelworks that need retread. In the mind of the Endtime scot-free isn’t possible. No interpretation necessary for your cargo. But tax and a search and a fee and a calibration what it all adds up to. Then drop it. Drop it down, send it off, may it disintegrate in peace.


"A GRAVITATIONALLY COLLAPSED OBJECT"

There’s a rip at the centre of me,
an old collapsed star that’s just
black hole and gravity now,
all my galaxies swirling slowly down its drain.

Is that what drew you in?
You’ve got a thing
for the ones who never smile?

The Devourer, I call it. The Black Dog.
It deforms space, time. Everything
twists towards the rip, I can’t aim anymore.
It swallows up word after word,
coins and rings and spoons,
leaving me with what’s left. I make do.
They don’t give names to black holes,
did you know that? Not like stars.

Yeah, I get how entropy works;
I’ve still got a lifetime
before it swallows me down. But
I feel like I’m always orbiting.
I think I want
a new sun.

They say that nothing
can escape the event horizon,
not even the speed of light.
So, then: you must be Nothing,
the way you stepped right up to its edge,
peered in, smiled at me over your shoulder —
and came back.

Hey, you.
How do you light up a room like that?
When you look at me,
can you see the stars in my eyes,
the hungry lacuna of my mouth?

Here. I hold out my hand:
an old, scratched-up key
snatched back from the event horizon.
If you want it, it’s for you.

At the end of all of us is
a place we don’t know,
a place beyond knowing.
What goes in never comes out.
What’s there —
beyond?
What did you see at my horizon
that made you want to come back and
take my hand?

There’s a rip at the centre of me, a black hole
that ate ten years and my name, and
no light can escape it
but yours.

"COMPASS NEEDLES"

The arrows on the road
match the arrows on
the inside of my arms.

Both move as I do,
compass needles
always pointing back

home. Quivering,
not for a place but
for a person, the one

who stopped the hourglass,
a grain of sand lodged
in the bottleneck.

It chafes, and the arrows
between my fingers itch,
constant reminders that

I’m gone. But you’re gone,
too. What do the arrows
want me to do? Grab a

shovel and dig up the body
that you left at the same
time you left me

scarred and tattooed with
grief? The scabs fell off
eventually, with more itching

after the needle finally
stopped. Inked all over with
maps that don’t make sense.

Miles and years without you,
and new arrows appear,
but they lead me nowhere.

I am still lost. 


"MORE NOISE THAN JUST THE WIND AND RAIN"

She likes being a harp more
than she ever liked being a woman
(both more than the thought of being a bird
with bones that break under the pressure of love)

Still before her body was broken down
to make this boney soundboard, this wired voice
golden down to its tarsal pedals

she’d play herself like an instrument-
fingers dug deep inside-
hands plugging holes in her neck-
to coax forth shining sounds just for her

In this city of corpses
turned into music
where one cello bows a ransom note
onto a second
and the pianos line up their keys
to write poison pen letters
that run their ink hard
down the canal for miles


"THE PURPOSE OF HOUSES IS BURNING THEM DOWN"

Every origin is a severing. 
I ended my idol worship with a lesson 
in houses. Bleached walls and a roof 
to seal secrets beneath a bed of filial piety. 
Ritual and obedience are the traits of animals, 
and I was better than fang and claw. 
Birds dropped wreathes of warning bells: 
be careful, or you’ll hurt yourself. But I carved 
myself loose from the bonds of the pack. 
I  crouch naked, reflecting the sun, 
let its fire bake away the blood, their blood, my blood. 
Every severing leaves a wound. 
I met a world 
full of wind and heat and panting scavengers. 
Not every wound is a tragedy. 
I wrote my holy books on their hides, 
and marched off to preach the gospel.


"SLEEPING VENUS"

When Giorgione paints her, she is a revolution, one arm
raised in rebellion, the other with fingers against the brush
strokes, her blushed and hidden sex. I study her mounted
in my office between interviews, before Amber tells me
everyone knew what was happening to me. The room is littered
with articles and lists, bullet pointed statistics that track
the I-40 corridor and the numbers of missing bodies, women
found in dumpsters. Venus, she is in a duffel bag tossed behind
a Homeland Grocery, nineteen years old. Two men, they say,
Obey, or end up dead. I am flayed open across headlines before
I open the door, and the rules tell me not to sensationalize or
sexualize victims. They say, reveling in the graphic details
does not help them, triggers trauma, tokenizes the survivors’
experience. Amber writes poetry and long monologues. She talks
about her body and the way it’s been used, about the type of men
who are never who you think they are. She sensationalizes, when
she speaks, she cries. This is what happens if you cross us. I trace
each tear as it tracks, note their salt next to each statistic: There are
twenty seven million slaves in the world, you can sell a woman
over and over again for years, Amber's journal reads my body is a cage
and I am still trapped inside the moment you held the key used to
cut me open. Two months later, police bust a major ring in Tulsa,
my city, powerless as they recover cell phones, cash, condoms,
poker chips as currency. You use the chip to pick the girl and not
one goes to the police. Instead mothers encourage their daughters,
involve family members, insist he's a good man, this is just a
misunderstanding. Amber tells me that she turned her mother in
because her younger sister turned seven and mother took pictures
of her wet in a bath, blushing over something as she dressed for
bed, promised her to a man online. What can I say when the world
breaks her open? Amber calls herself a whore. Jeannetta says
I never got paid. Fifteen, a boyfriend took her, innocent and
excited, to a house at the corner of Main. Promised her protection,
sold her to strangers. When they drove off I was still there,
she says, I was what was left. Beaten bloody and stabbed
thirty-six times, she raises her fist to handcuffs. Anna shares
a name with my youngest niece, same caramel skin, she was branded
with hot iron, burned with acid, pistol whipped, gang raped. Once
he filled the bathtub with gin, made me sit with open sores, held
a gun to my stomach. She is twelve when she runs away from her
mother who is only a shadow cowering in corners from hands that miss
her child. Anna misses her father who is an empty well in her chest,
a gaping hole between her arms. Warehoused with girls younger than
she is, they teach her sex while braiding her hair. I meet her
seven years later, she says in the dark she can still hear the whistles,
a train, dogs growling. I think about jumping, she says, but I don't
want to die. I think of Venus, the pastoral scene behind her, green
trees and the simple emptiness of a field, sheets pale against her ivory
skin, red at her back. What can we say, we who have never bled?


"HOBO SYMBOLS"

I claim all the kingdoms as my own. I sign my name across their dust. A wilderness aims to erase the flag of my feet, so I become a tattoo. Hot ink flows from a broken fountain like a kiss from a lamb, a bite from a dog, a gag against the molten smoke. By fire, under the cold blanket of night, I build golden cairns and castles. Can moths be monarchs? There is a church on the moon that holds a crown and a calculus of tombstones. There are no roads, but countless paths to get there.


"HOME REMEDIES FOR ANGER"

Do not exile yourself. In a wasteland 
filled with vampires and messiahs, resolution
comes with a stake, 
the whole desert an offering. 
The difference 
between a pulpit and a stage 
is an altar. 
Skulls become censers 
before the torn shroud. 
No mud left 
for creation, mere muscle and blood. In a wasteland,
there is no hunting or honey – 
the vultures hang on a rack
threadbare as a cleric’s robe. 
If you make a fist, let it be around the heft of a hammer, 
or cut your fingers off – 
there is so much room for hate in a barren world, 
and so little wood for pyres, for caskets, for fence posts. 
Save your voice for when the visions come. 
The mornings of after.
So much water escapes with each breath, 
no prosthetic can replace, no pilgrimage atone.
In a history that is trying to exorcise you, 
the only way to cry to a foreign god 
is in tongues.



"NINE FACTS FROM THE KUIPER BELT"

1.
The janitor of Pluto once slipped off the sparkling orb of ice-dust and into the empty embrace of its lonely orbit. This is how he met his wife, Charon, in his younger days.

2.
The janitor of Pluto believes monarchy to be the one true form of government. He imagines being ruled by butterflies on a distant crystal ball.

3.
The janitor of Pluto does not know his home is not a planet. He claims he built Nix and Styx and the rest so Charon wouldn’t be lonely. He tried to make them look like butterflies.

4.
The janitor of Pluto went to Mercury once. Sweeping the flatlands of Pluto can’t compare to the dizzying thrill of racing down the terminator line, hands in the air, fingers inches from solar flares, heat softening his lover’s frozen flesh.

5.
The janitor of Pluto carries colored clouds from vacations to the methane ocean of Jupiter and the sky-mines of Neptune. At night they wrap around his head. He cannot dream without them.

6.
The janitor of Pluto has a recurring dream where he rides a comet in the shape of a ’64 Mustang convertible. He could never afford one. His favorite color is ambient white, like the glow of a million distant stars.

7.
The janitor of Pluto wants a prison tattoo, but he is his world’s only yardbird. His favorite work song is “Sixteen Tons”. He has never seen coal, but owns one secret diamond.

8.
The janitor of Pluto has scars covering his body. His ex-wife, Charon, thought they made him look like the moon. She took everything but his body and broom. She also gave him a crater.

9.
The janitor of Pluto tripped over a caterpillar on the dark side of his property. He is nursing it back to health. He will be sad when it grows up into a butterfly with a million colors, not ambient white, to rule a crystal ball. But it is worth it for this journey, he thinks.


"METALS"

What are arms 
when your hands are in the air 
and the knives are buried in another back? 
This is no time to name your fists 
Iron and Steel – the metals you pulled 
from the wrecked soil of your ribs, 
metals you forged 
in the tender ashes of the sun, metals 
to hammer new seeds into the exhausted earth. 
The metals look the same 
but are pronounced differently. 
The weight of days and words built them 
like bombs, critical mass at the end of your limbs – 
the explosion was inevitable. 
You were born to be a salvo. 
The metals are your fingerprints, 
and your arms are the evidence 
they belong to you.


"RIPE ORANGES"

Orange flowers 
explode into gold 
under aging 
moonlight, 
their sweet smell 
like love’s fever.
The oranges are plump 
with spring, and we 
slice them open.
Their bursting perfume 
pierces the black air. 
We eat them before 
they fall, because we know 
the universe does not see us, 
because we know 
we are candles
holding small flames 
waiting for the wind.


"WAR"

The shotgun spread us out like so much buckshot, a thin blanket, poison, the lead our feet left behind. Our cages are caught somewhere between oxidation and restoration, the rust of time, the coarse polish of migratory sands. We blew through the flesh of a younger world before we learned heaven is no land for trenches and foxholes. The physics of velocity that we never understood, didn’t choose targets. We were all the enemy. Dictate and duty fit like a second-hand uniform. We wear them, now, like surgeons – uneasy, with hands we wrest steady. Our tongues dream of water and the tang of blood in shared spit, a proximity of wrath and rapture. The desert is full of bodies, now, but in the distance I can see, maybe, a phone booth I can call you from.


"WITHERING"

You step, 
left, right, 
until the only enemies left 
are the barren acres. 
When all you want are grass stains, 
and all you have are memories, 
you plant new seeds. 
When you sew where the soil is stone, 
the grass grows fast, dies fast, 
feels more like a bed of nails than a cradle. 
In an empty meadow, 
the mailbox fills with topsoil. 
When you lift your head 
to look in the mirror it falls, breaks, 
cracks in glass form like crags in the land. 
The earth bleeds dust, and you 
learn there can be no peace 
in a hostile environment. 
Still, you wonder, where are the doves 
and the olive branches? Surely they are waiting 
somewhere green 
and soft 
and full of water.


"DISCIPLES, SURRENDER"

The sun washes color away, 
until I am nothing but contrast. 
Living, I come as a nomad 
to a field of sand, stretching, 
like death, in every direction. 
On my march I have farmed 
an agriculture of tumbleweeds into nests. 
I have learned a dry branch 
makes the best lit torch, 
and all this grit was once water. 
There is no need to tread further – 
home is not a place, 
but an idea in darkness. 
So build a temple. 
Build a house. 
Practice the discipline of dwelling. 
And like a bird that has lost its voice, 
the sea will return
to paint a landscape and its tenants less picaresque.


"THINGS PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN IN LETTERS TO GHOSTS"

Remember the time we woke up too late to watch the sun rise and the sky was already bright [space/page changes/something is not connected] and you said you thought you saw the color drain from your eyes when you looked in that mirror [space] once I meant to tell you that the windows were beginning to crack [page changes] under the weight of the water, that’s a phrase you used to describe how stones must feel after they stop skipping, why would [something is not connected] you say something like that? [space] The doctor told me to hold my breath when I felt the first twinge of pain and if it lasted longer than I could keep the breath in than I should get help. What kind of [page changes] dreams do you have at night? Or is there just an emptying out? Like when you sleep after a fever has broken and in the morning you can’t remember anything except that you feel new? [something is not connected] I kept all of the pebbles you collected and I spread them over the bottom of the bathtub and filled it with ice water and when I climbed in it felt like I was in a lake and I thought that I could hear the wind through trees but it was only the house settling down with no one moving about and [space] often I imagine that you are still here only you no longer live in this city and you no longer have the same phone number and maybe your name has changed and that is why I never hear from you anymore. Does that seem [page changes] like something I should have told you sooner? I meant to, you know. But I thought you knew. I just [something is not connected] keep thinking about how we ran outside anyway and kept going until we reached the top of the hill and you said that if we just ran fast enough than the sun would rise again


"FROM THE STALAGMITE, CARVES THE SAND"

You think me flesh,
but I am stone – behold what the desert has done
to my hands, bring your weathered fingertips
and trace the cracks;
with charcoal and familiar pressure
make a rubbing 
of my etched face, I will not wear it long,
no, I am trying to break free, like a falcon,
aching with each beat of blood
for the hood to be lifted, to be uncaged,
to stare at you, unblinking,
in the glare of a new sun,
knowing you see right through me.


"THE DESERT QUEEN HOLDS PARLIAMENT"

I came with a backpack
full of books. They taught me
how to build a gun
from the emptiness inside, 
from the emptiness circling like birds, they taught me
what animals are made of – 
soft tissue, cartilage, heart,
parts that fail.
I left with a holster
full of lead, I walk now
with a steady eye,
everything moving in relation to me,
everything moving as an arm of the horizon,
I walk now
less flesh, more stone,
carrying blood-black trophies
in my backpack.
So If your wing is broken, 
shoot it off,
or I’ll do it for you.


"WHY I PAUSE DRAWING THE BEDROOM CURTAINS"

There is a lamppost two doors down the street
grown into the branches of a lime tree.
Night fallen, the leaves are a jellyfish,
a bioluminescent dance
swimming softly down the street
towards me in the rain.


"AFTERWAR"

I see a clothesline and wonder – do you remember making love behind the folding screen, while outside birdsong of hunger and reproduction echoed off the window? How they ate the frogs and left the heads beneath the laundry hanging on the line, fig leaves still hanging on the trees instead of glued to my body, glued to yours. When we are reduced to our flesh, what is left to strip away? Hair of the wilderness. Scales and silence. What sounds do we make when there is no breath left, and the gears of the sun have ground our pulse to dust? In the hush-hush of the dawn, we learned to read with closed eyes every freckle and there was so much blood, still, inside us.


"OVUM"

You can forget about the eggs when you’re dead – 
how their shells are the same cast as a skull, 
how you washed the baby’s hair, 
how your skin cracked 
like the wasteland you always knew it was 
from the bleach in the sink – 
but the sun and its scorch remind you of your breath. 
The pain comes when your skin stretches, 
seared shoulders of a china doll 
never meant to carry the burden of fire, 
a lesson in differences – basted or boiled, 
shattered or whole. You keep drawing the invisible air 
with a straw, plastic bags, a loose rubber band 
holding each inhalation together with a leak, 
a little wind escaping back to the atmosphere 
to fan the flames of a new day. 
You’re burning – 
an egg unattended – 
so hungry, and the sky is so bright, 
and you’re supposed to make breakfast. 


"NUCLEAR DECAY"

I have wheeled to the end, 
and I have learned that the flood plain 
is no place to build sandcastles. 
How many caskets in the ground did it take 
to make the grass so green? How many kings and queens 
sat unquestioningly upon their thrones 
as the ramparts dissolved around them? 
I am radiant, because I wear my triumph 
on my lesioned skin. 
If I accomplished nothing else, 
at least I can say I was not comfortable, 
that I razed the fortress of my childhood righteousness, 
that I hoisted the sun in the desert, 
that I saw both the blurry ends of the earth 
and the end of the world.  
I do not move anymore – 
I have counted the collapse of every waveform but my own. 
Without motion, I can see the stars shoot, 
I can see the grass. It is beginning to snow, 
and I am dreaming.


"GRAVITY OF HEARTS"

At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless; Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is, But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity, Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards, Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point, There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
- T.S. Eliot, from 'Burnt Norton'

gravity (grav-i-tee) from Latin: gravitas (weight) from gravis (heavy)

n.
1. Natural force by which bodies tend to attract each other

v.
1. On a blue-green cat’s eye marble hurtling around a five billion year old explosion we
meet. Our hearts spin like gyroscopes, defying forces that keep our feet on the ground despite the world trying to throw us into the depths of space as it rotates over sixteen hundred kilometers per hour. At such colossal speeds, our muscles, like taffy, stretch. Our most intimate bones twist. Our personal orbits bend into little girl braids and little boy licorice strings.

Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation:  There’s a locus that everything is always falling toward, pulled toward, moths of blood and bone and dust toward the core of molten light. When bodies get close enough, they get pulled in, vectoring along invisible  between them. The energy ebbs and flows, in and out, as fingers grasp haptic, hectic, desperate to latch on, hold private symbiosis, marionette and puppeteer.
We form an ellipse, a spiral, a line cascading data, words carrying weight – weight implying mass. Densities that collect and build up in the heart, dancing through private chambers, collapsing realities as links form, sinew to red sinew.

g = 9.80665 m/s2

Standing a meter apart the force between us is approximately 3.27 * 10-7. As we get closer, face to face, the distance between lips measured in centimeters, the force increases to 8.17 * 10-6. This is the burning distance, inescapable, wrapped in the warping fabric of space-time as we cross event horizons.
On the moon we are a hammer and feather, falling at the same rate. The moon pulls the
oceans slowly lapping up the surface of the cat’s eye. Gyroscope puppet strings pull the oceans in the spinning masses of our chests. We standardize the bump and slosh and eddies with an additional ring around the extremities of the gyro.

Tidal Locking: When one side of a body always faces another in synchronous rotation. One body takes just as much time to rotate around the other as it does to spin on its own axis. When the objects are similar in mass and the physical distance between them is small, both may be tidally locked to each other.
Hand in hand, hand on shoulder, hand on the small of the back. We’re all hands as we wrap each other in tug-of-war and secrets, crush each other to singularity, form a partnership, binary black holes in a lover’s dance.

Ballet Physics: Gravity is the only force acting on a dancer in the air. To calculate leaps, a dancer must account for their vertical velocity, their mass, and their horizontal speed. Done properly, alone or with a partner, a dancer can create the illusion of floating as the motion of the
head is smaller than the motion of the dancer’s center of gravity. The motion of each
jump can be defined by a parabolic function.
In the end we form a Lagrange point, a celestial lacuna, stationary in space as time expands and the universe expands, and our five billion year old explosion expands, and nothing is left between us but information. 


"THE VERTEX OF THE PARABOLA IS WHERE THINGS TURN AROUND"
 
There is a world stuck somewhere
between sepia and grayscale,
where the colors do not bleed, they play
climbing monkey bars or prison, ironclad
swimming pools forever out of reach:
 
We are not made for the water,
it is made for us, steam powered
machine made machines making
a torso sliced and slid –
and entire childhood down the stairs.
 
There is a bomb hanging in the air, almost
out of sight, like a piece of chalk
disappearing, both ends. Cut to the center
as it burns its last gas trying
to outrun freight trains on the beach:
 
A memory of home, constructed
when the word meant something – stable,
a warm barn all connected lumber, steel nails,
a skyscraper to leap from. A table is there –
it has no chairs.


"FACE OF SKULL, EDGE OF BREAST"
 
Ophelia, your fossil tears this skull down to salt,
water to fill vacancies of wine and honey
in your empty pool, poor Yorick’s hole –
I would embalm your lips with echoes
pulled through your floating bones
reverberated in blood, each shiver
a little fire, a map of sutures
holding together skeletons and prophecy.
 
How could you drown? There is only a stream,
more shallow than sycophants –
you must have been barefoot,
soft flesh of your sole skipping a stone, heart
beat. Was it quirk or quiet drum? Were you
all fear when the window became the world?
 
Descent is not curved
like your breast. When you landed
your eyes flew away, the color of sail,
ghosts, a broken wake of your keening
words – I miss your voice that reflected
as much light as your pale nipples
under the gauze of this dead moon,
now the rosemary has gone.
 
Your eyes are lost, Ophelia –
I can't see them anymore.


"THIS GREAT STAGE OF FOOLS, IT SMELLS OF MORTALITY"

We are born into daggers, full of more,
our own, and the first lips open unreadable,
a fathomless circle pulling tight its garrote of simple words,
knowing they hold more future than promise:
        Let me teach you a tongue.
 
There is no knowledge, only information
where we grow in sunlight, where the cold turns
fruit to madness, and ripeness is all –
prophecy of youth reaped in elderly ear hair,
and what comes between is jest.
 
We harvest only mystery in darkness,
holy spies. We forget how cold birth is,
how absurd to trust the tameness of a wolf,
touch of a hand, a rogue oath. We forget
there is a razor in my pie, a key in yours, we forget,
even our first cry, and every after, means the same:
        Who is it that can tell me who I am?
 
Let’s go to prison. Let’s wear out in walls –
walking circles cannot be worse, no, alone
in a place where I can bless you
with the fresh salt of my body,
and you can forgive me with yours. We will live
criminals and victims, nameless numbers,
and we will not have to speak, only laugh.


"IT LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE A PILL, I WILL NEED MORE WATER"

This is a strange egg,
she is hatching from it soon –
a walking blush, a bear trap.
 
Shot arrows lodge, crossings,
a proud and empty frame to hold
wit and the spark of her eyes,
the light that dreams woe and wakes laughing.
 
She comes to burn the errors –
no angel, she cannot love as she beats away
the turncoat courtesy of shame.
 
Her mouth, a jet, a broken seal,
the truth,
all albumen and iron,
she has not made herself to be held,
but swallowed.


"I FIND MY EBBING ZENITH"

We will dissolve
like any storm we forge, the furious gales
we build. Unwrought, I acknowledge
all the rifted corners are mine.
 
You don’t spirit the pieces of this shipwreck –
how they suspend themselves, together fit
midair, condense to anvil grey puzzles of thunder –
you don’t know which axis
I spin it on. I loom your fabric, a hurricane,
and I spin on.
 
There are no kings here, only dreams and current,
a lulling recursion of wind and shimmer,
the gossamer wave of air
before buried lightning erupts,
a flux, an inheritance of sand, fused,
blown glass,
mirrored steps to the sky.
 
The temple rumbles, the empty spire holds
nothing, sees nothing,
not the beach, not the crypt, all the devils
here, the scrim
drawn over hell, runes beneath the book of bones
weighing down this ragged altar –
the staff is a nail
in the wood of a heart.
 
A little life circulates like so much heaven,
melted into air,
into thin air:
stratosphere cracked, ozone crackling in the schism,
this wild squall is the final curse,
a blessed endgame will bury us
certain fathoms in the earth, rounded by sleep.


"SANS MACHINA"

Maybe it’s a revolver, a bullet
in each chamber, six circling round,
until each chamber, by turn, is empty.
 
A blind eye sees we are shot
down the barrel of the corridor,
and all the world's a hallway –
all fine moldings and sconces,
just garnish for doorways, no muzzle,
exits and entrances that don’t open, don’t close.
 
This is a trap with teeth
ground shut. This is rust, the metallic blood
taste tongued from the smooth cells of a cheek.
 
The walls of the scene turn on
stripped gears,
pipes and whistles in its sound –
this is the last scene of all,
strange, skinless and without nerve,
a mere oblivion.


"FIRE BURNS IN THE LAST SYLLABLE OF RECORDED TIME"

Here we are inside the face,
constructed of warlike shield and vaulted ambition –
there are daggers in our smiles, daggers
in the snakes of our fingers,
and they smell like ribless lilies.
 
Here there are whispers –
the sound of something wicked told by an idiot
and we cannot see the blood, the jump, the life to come,
we cannot see it will have more blood,
a wash of shadow and fury.
 
We lay on words of our own, maybe spells,
troubles and ghosts, how they rule our damned hands.
 
Here the air smells of anvil heat,
a great forging, but we do not know
if we are gold-crowned or crone-woven –
a burnt skull fixed upon the battlements,
signifying nothing.


"A TORCH IS NOT A TENDER THING"

Behold the plague of one moon, two houses,
a sundial awaiting daylight, a silent aubade,
a holy shrine of crossings:
 
half the lips of a single saint,
knees locked together,
torsos glued with sweat,
the candlelit curve of an ass,
a knife in the small of a back –
 
there is no bridge between these things,
just the hope for one,
a dream laced together from heretics.


"BRUISED ORANGES"

We are made to carry,
starting with toys, expectations growing
with larger hands, longer arms,
longer legs. Are we closer to God
when we carry something? 

Dust settles as our movement slows,
settles on us, knickknacks and dolls,
filled with potential. The tap runs
constantly. We expect hands
to steady us in a tornado. Hands
give us a storm to bear – 
we cannot take the sky
and cram it into a teapot.

Someday, we all grow 
into universes, paralleled 
in makeup mirrors. We contain 
infinite reflections, the weight of lead, 
and tales we tell in passing. Notions 
of wonder, silver-plated passions 
for computer science and photography.

Even painted, 
we cannot maintain 
the appearance of angels when we juggle
like clowns. We trip over our shoes – 
we are so full, our small hands
can not carry each other so well, anymore.


"VIRGA"

She’s in the kitchen again, 
floating, nimbus,
and I’m watching the news loop
every half hour. I critique 
the wardrobe of every anchor,
but it doesn’t matter what they wear,
the news doesn’t change
between 4 PM and 10 PM. It doesn’t change,
just like the weather doesn’t change,
but they speak
anyway. They share a robbery,
a murder, a forest fire, and the weather comes on – 
a chance of rain 
that will never touch the ground. In the kitchen
a sizzle as she deglazes a copper pan,
water and oil, yes, and alcohol, 
in an atmosphere that only gets thicker. Out the window
I see a skirt of water, the hem too high, 
and I only smell dinner, not wet earth. in the living room 
the sheer drapes move
in the wind. Wine dresses and undresses 
the sides of her glass. There is thunder 
when the food is served
but she says nothing. Tomorrow will be the same.


"BETWEEN THE ELEMENTS, SO FULL OF SHAPES"

There is nothing.
 
A hole in a heart and the things that fill it –
the arms are gone, that emptiness left behind
has always been, like a dried rose
once bloomed, a wet tongue
full of wilted words;
no, there was a kiss once, fragile as an egg,
and lips that went along, breathing,
beating hearts on a silver platter,
an alter couched in the infinite math of limbs
trying to speak the same language
in rhythms polar, glaciers grinding down
the landscape of flesh, wasting
so slow that boulders grow
like roses. The flowers
have always been, will always untangle
if watered with time, sweet as it was before,
and after, they will fill the empty spaces.


"A BRIGHT PARTICULAR STAR"

I am supplied with the habit, kneeling
on this virgin sheet, heart nothing but heavy
gold leaf, it reflects a point of light,
strong and ancient, bleeding like a comet
as it nears a tyrannous sun – there is heaven
in my mouth, bait for saints and birds of prey.
 
I pray:
come test my metal, taste
what may within me hide –
an angel, hiding more, a sword
I will bear until it buries me, to the end of reckoning,
where death unloads its dark ingots and wraps me again
in a sheet, just like this.


"SOME DAYS I TASTE HONEY"

I used to burst into full aliveness. I used to be able                to burst                     into full aliveness.

Heaven already knows about this:     my excitability,           my tendency                 to look for God

in everything.                  Now, and only some days                   I may taste a bitty wisp        of honey

in my morning tea.       As in—aliveness          as in—joy       as in—nectar and                 elixir and

horse-like                         prancing through the forest              here comes my little fork,             full

of thorns again.              Daily we frolic               on and off     and some days, it’s    cold cardboard

or wet, sour wrongness—      think       salt-sharp, think    orange juice               after toothpaste.

Now I must eat                with my eyes                  and try not to wither away.               No one knows

about this:                         how I got sick and got sick and           got sick     and because I was alone

in a new city        unsure of what would come flapping out of my cupped hands:    my sick-self

my secret gallop             or my divine rearranging,             and after years of swimming the edge

of sustenance,     of nourishment—         I feel hungry     always            and never             and now

I don’t know what to do with all the honey I have left.                           I have so much honey left.


"PANSIES & CUCUMBERS"

One of the nurses laughs,
the other knows sea water.

Where is the doctor
my mother cries, and when can we see 
what is going to happen?

She is behind me 
at this first moment of breathing,
bleeding and preserving the walls of our house – 
she will tell me later how the windows shook,
how I was born with strength
to raise more than gardens.

We are gifted
with incomprehensible prophecy. I fall in love
with the legend of Cassandra, with my mother
crying in the sun, planting pansies and cucumbers.

A garden rises,
lives – it does not return. 

Where is the doctor
my mother cries, and when can we see
what is going to happen?

I only return to stand behind her
at her last moment of breathing. When I scream 
the windows do not shake, and I know
her power is not mine.

What is going to happen? I know
laughter and sea water
and nothing but questions.


"THE RECIPE CARD IS LOST, BUT I AM COOKING"

Some days, I watch the world outside the picture windows
slowly reduce, like the tomato sauce my mother taught me – 
an almost imperceptible evaporation. Like the windows,
I mirror the loss. The shovel of my shoulder blade digs 
into the soft parts of my spirit as much as the sofa. I feel
hot bubbles rise through me, burst out. I leave pieces of myself
where I don’t belong. I know this house is mine, 
but it is not home, because I unmade the comfort with silence
and the quiet recitation of veins we can call natural productivity – 
I know the particulate of dust is falling in the open cupboards
as the flowing graphite curtains close across the sky. Soon,
the rain will be louder than the gas burner on the stove,
and I will have to get up to check the sauce. Taste it, adjust,
keep an eye on it before it disappears completely


"TO THE DOGS, FOLLOWING THE UNKINDEST CUT"

What do you do with Caesar?
 
Rejoice! The ruling hand figures no more fantasies,
just facts of havoc and bleeding earth
to rule the blazing heavens.
 
That Colossus and his marble filled a narrow world
with faulted stars, error-riddled calculations –
don’t count the coins now over his eyes,
a head of honor, a tale of death;
just dissect, open that chest like a book,
put a pin in it, butterfly,
you will find no bars to hold a spirit
wheeling free from the math of vectors and ascent.
 
Let the shadow of Cicero speak
his SPQR algebra:
 
This broken statue, ruins of Rome
washed out like the bones of conspiracy,
must be read like the carcass it is –
the entrails speak the silent lines of a ghost
asking to be made mountain.
 
So, make him one.


"MERCY IS ABOVE THIS SCEPTRED SWAY"

Infinity is stacked,
a loop of poison, a loop of laughter,
all senses crossed and tossing on the ocean.
 
Though the music is cut
in the alabaster of memory,
the strange frame of nature does not glister
if the sun is not burnished.
 
Shall we not revenge?
 
Song is not here, alone,
it is wept from the vinegar testimony of a needle prick,
howled from the fractured pipes of the organ’s grin,
it remembers all the scripture
cited by the devil –
the keys played by the hands of Erebus
will be brushed free of treasons and stratagems,
bettered and brought to concord.


"IF YOUR BREATH IS PITCHED FOR FIRE, YOU MUST LIGHT IT"

This is the wheel of rehabilitation,
a righteous mountain, a spiral stair
without a railing.
 
The winds will push you headlong
into the fiery flood, the womb hell
born again as a prison,
ribs of ice around the cyclone of your breath;
catch it. Do not let it escape, hold it
in the widening chasm of failures, attempts.
 
There is a hole in the pavement of your virtue,
just sidestep, if you must, or climb
the ladder of your sin. Up or down, direction does not matter –
in a storm, all paths lead to death.
 
This is the flight of redemption,
so, do not ask for charity
in a forge made of faults – the hammer will mold
your vice to victory, your temptation to a keen edge of temper:
 
You will become something better.


"FRIEDRICH ENGELS HAD A BEARD, SO FAT, LIKE FALSTAFF"

There is divinity in odd numbers –
we say they share a center,
orbit equidistant like good communists.
 
If your wallet is long, make it shorter, comrade,
and if short, we’ll give you gold
in clams and oysters.
 
Give some trust,
and we’ll give you some daylight to burn
until the candles and starlight and moonshine are out.
 
We are all married by chance to death,
so let us drink down the unkindness of nativity
together.


"IN A FINE FRENZY ROLLING, IMAGINATION BODIES FORTH"

Being naught but patched fools,
we pass back into the forest
through the sun and an arch
in the sky of coiled lightning.
 
Among the trees
we are nothing but legs and dance –
so much wind,
so much rope
accompanied by shadows
and the iron tongue of midnight.
 
This planted place is where we together
like a double cherry grow,
two rivers giving tribute
to each other.
 
As the water rises
past the shifting lines of wit
we will blur like chalk,
and if we are only leaves of a dream
the earth’s girdle will tremble
when our bracts become bears –
that is the true beginning of our end.


"FOR THE LOVE OF PHYSICS"

Oh,
my little vector,
how I follow you 
hither to thither –

thou art 
better than any scalar.

Your resistance 
decreases 
my current
initially, 

but my momentum carries
me through to 
maximum EMF.
.
You accelerate my velocity,
charge my capacitance,

oh, my solenoid 
you incline my potential energy!

You intensify my electric field
summarise Coulomb’s law.

Better than the apple 
are you
for this Newton

No longer am I inert - 

I accelerate towards your force
and try to exert an 

equal but
opposite love
upon you


“POPULATIONS”

I learned that people are obsessed with learning. I learned that I have to eat bacon and cheese for
breakfast, or I might forget the love I used to feel when a stranger’s eye caught mine as I crossed
Winchester on a morning walk. Well, not love. I learned that love might not be real. I learned
that even if I say certain words, I might only mean them as much as my cat who rubs against my
leg after forgetting it already ate two breakfasts. I learned that I can go 618 days without seeing
my family and only just start to miss them. I learned that wheat, onions, beans, apples,
nectarines, garlic, and dairy make me sick, and that 4,725,899 people can die and someone will
still call it a hoax. I learned that I am autistic. I learned that I want more. I learned the lie of an
evening and how long it takes for my desires to become my desires. I learned that feelings come
and go. Like fathers. Like love. Like 617 empty days.


"TO BE IN A BODY"

I can walk for hours in wildflower fields,
and meet no one,
The same way I walked this house’s halls
The same way I followed a boy’s spirit
him to be real: If I could study
how a child looks after
Looking through him is looking
under my tongue. Its hum.
this baby had hers.
I housed two hearts
What separated us was
In my dreams, I waded
—I couldn’t slide into the trunk’s rings:
I was biting the tree’s base. I was a hound.
Anything that could turn wild.
Your fences. Walk toward evening.
If I could hold a lion’s head.
Make way for song. Stay
so short a time. This voice
This voice, so short
a song, a lion’s jaw, a heart
white hard hills
	
up my spine’s white hard hills,
and meet no one.
before a baby moved in my gut.
in this dark house, wanting
his topography to see
he leaves his body.

In the mornings, I had my body--
Believe it, for a time,
that wanted different lives.
my skin and bone webs.
through water: what’s on the other side?
—I couldn’t fold into the tree’s leaves.
I was a horse. A hare. Anything wild.
Someone said, hang a birdhouse.

If I could place its teeth on my throat.
outside. Because we are together

a time. Any of us could be
loud in a bone web,
in this dark house.


"VOICES OF THE AIR"

But then there comes that moment rare
When, for no cause that I can find,
The little voices of the air
Sound above all the sea and wind.

The sea and wind do then obey
And sighing, sighing double notes
Of double basses, content to play
A droning chord for the little throats—

The little throats that sing and rise
Up into the light with lovely ease
And a kind of magical, sweet surprise
To hear and know themselves for these—

For these little voices: the bee, the fly,
The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,
The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,
The shrill quick sound that the insect makes.


"GARDEN ABSTRACT"

The apple on its bough is her desire,—
Shining suspension, mimic of the sun.
The bough has caught her breath up, and her voice,
Dumbly articulate in the slant and rise
Of branch on branch above her, blurs her eyes.
She is prisoner of the tree and its green fingers.

And so she comes to dream herself the tree,
The wind possessing her, weaving her young veins,
Holding her to the sky and its quick blue,
Drowning the fever of her hands in sunlight.
She has no memory, nor fear, nor hope
Beyond the grass and shadows at her feet.


"GHAZAL"

The sky is a dry pitiless white. The wide rows stretch on into death.
Like famished birds, my hands strip each stalk of its stolen crop: our name.

History is a ship forever setting sail. On either shore: mountains of men,
Oceans of bone, an engine whose teeth shred all that is not our name.

Can you imagine what will sound from us, what we’ll rend and claim
When we find ourselves alone with all we’ve ever sought: our name?

Or perhaps what we seek lives outside of speech, like a tribe of goats
On a mountain above a lake, whose hooves nick away at rock. Our name

Is blown from tree to tree, scattered by the breeze. Who am I to say what,
In that marriage, is lost? For all I know, the grass has caught our name.

Having risen from moan to growl, growl to a hound’s low bray,
The voices catch. No priest, no sinner has yet been taught our name.

Will it thunder up, the call of time? Or lie quiet as bedrock beneath
Our feet? Our name our name our name our fraught, fraught name.


"RITE"

working with willow rods that’s the method,
bring great bundles of them,
put on the ground scatter them
pronounce them, saying:

“here’s one”
“here’s another one”
“here’s one, there…over there…”

willow rods, very consoling          we’ll clear the ground
you don’t have to be a Scythian…

and then the ones behaving more like women use a different method

they take a piece of the inner bark of a lime tree
cut it into many pieces
which they keep twisting and untwisting around their fingers as they
make effigies of themselves, willow rods of women saying:

“there’s a turn”
“there’s a turning”
“there’s a rowdy one”
“there’s a moist one”

“there’s one we lost to negligent wind”
“another one burned up”
“one folded down a sparrow’s cheek”
“how many turnings in a twisty one?”

a million, more than you can ever hold
makes the pronouncers happy
surveyors of tractor and sage
and when all goes out

remember eclipse telling you this could all go out
women too?

but for love & mystery
willows rods, willows rods
you know this
to fool the hearts of men

staying up all night, notice the moon and its macabre signal

and hemp vapor tents on the horizon

walk upside down in the footprints of the living


“FIRSTS”

A twin bed tucked inside a closet, a hot pink room at the end of a hall.
Your ecstasy overflows, and I think, Is this it?
Late-night phone calls, dreaming Paris, green velveteen cushions,
a piano on hardwood floors in an attic apartment, a bed on the floor.
Time is a movie running backward down the street lined with dogwood trees.
A nickname I’m given because of you, little dick fucker,
a secret taunt of a loser who doesn’t know: sometimes less is more.
A tryst of understanding, your memory twists and frays, a message given,
I am not good for you—so they say—I am not good for you, Your soul in the balance.
We don’t know that this is temporary.
Still a child, roaming with my friends, summer budding from our eyes,
and then, you, curly hair and capricious grin, and your hand takes my heart.
A betrayal, and my memory twists and shames, a message received,
I am not good for Him—so they say—I am not good, Repent, my soul in the balance.
None of this is temporary.
A phone call of a different sort, standing on the curb, my life pans around me.
You sob, and I can’t hear your voice above the music.
We don’t know that this is temporary.


"A MATHEMATICALLY PERFECT HEART"

Leonardo da Vinci took oxen
hearts and poured molten wax into them,
trying to discover how the valves worked,
how the blood entered and exited
the muscle. He made diagrams and wrote
his notes back-to-front in mirror writing—
this might have been because he thought the heart
a secret thing or maybe, being
left-handed, he found it easier
to pull the quill than push against the grain.

From the wax cast of the oxen heart,
he made a mould of gypsum for blowing
thin glass inside. The strange transparent heart
must have caught the light, frozen as it was
in time; mathematically perfect,
an exposed aorta in Italian sun.
But if he had asked it to beat, if
da Vinci had placed it in a body
of his own invention, the body would have
suffocated in immaculate silence.


“PRACTICE”

You, a knee between my legs,
Me, a tongue colliding—
We were practicing, but for what?
You disappeared. I married the opposite of
Femininity, bones and rough edges, and you
Became an anecdote, a memory, a fragment of shame.


“JUNIPER SEEDS”

Pine makes
a tenuous home
in my mouth and
you, above, aloof,
move inside me, but
I wonder, How did we get
here? from where we stood
before, and you ask me, Where
do you want it? but the question evades
the forest growing from my throat and I am
lost in the trees and the weeds planted years ago,
hazy, unaware of the flower we might be planting now


“CONVERSATIONS”

What can you tell me that the wall cannot?
I stare for hours and ask her
my questions, hoping she has some kind of
truth that will seep from her flaking,
many-layered paint, but she doesn’t
answer; don’t worry.
But neither do you, your blank stare reflecting
my words without a single ounce of
recognition, of
points registering, of
compassion.
At least the wall doesn’t
have eyes that can gaslight me
without so much
as a single shift.


“LONGING”

I hear the silverware clack as you put it away in the other room,
your extra chores attempts to bridge the divide that grows between us,
and I wonder:
do deep connections exist,
or is this a lie the movies tell us?
Will my soul ever ache for another person,
or will it ache forever for the absence of one,
the space they could have filled
if they had made themselves known to me?


“THE GIRL IN THE CHECKOUT ISLE”

and does her husband know
that when she sees her, butterflies
twitch
like a school-girl crush, the way her smile
pulls at the corners of her mouth,
just slightly; the way her slight frame holds
so much beauty; does her husband know
that she can’t keep her heart from
longing
for the knowledge of her touch?


“I HAVE LOST A LOT”

What if, when I said your name, it wasn’t a lie anymore? What if it spilled through the cracks in
my marigold Anthropologie curtains and wove between the particles of dust and dissipated into
the air like clove and orange oil room mist, but less heavy, more resilient? What if, when I said
your name, it came with a touch, your hand at the nape of my neck where the hair dye never
seems to reach, your lips hungry against my shoulder? What if your name meant goldenrod and
gleaming and magnificence and your lip print melted into my skin like an invisible tattoo? What
if, when I said your name, you said mine, and we pretended, for a moment, it had always been
that way?


"RELICS"

There are trilobyte fossils in Taos – 
we are standing in a rock shop
holding hands, fingers 
sticking out from our palms 
like stone legs. There is no more motion.
We talk about how old they are, how young
we are, what the water must have been like. The ebb
still existing, even now, but the life is gone.

You tell me I’m crying, and I still believe you.
No tenderness in your stone, I touch my own face,
one finger, one drop of my own ocean
I place on the eternal beach of the smallest fossil. 
It costs twenty dollars. You buy it for me, 
handing me a paper bag in the car. 
The wind blows. It’s dry and my lips are chapped. 
I rub chapstick on my ridges. The bag doesn’t move. 


"DEW DOES NOT REMAIN FOR LONG"

The humidity swallows your breath
before it even leaves 
your body. The clouds, whales, 
and the sun shines bleach into your hair.
A soft rumble that could be the sky
or blood 
in your eardrum –  the weight of thunder 
used to be measured in sandbags, 
steep levees at the creek bank,
solid gold insurance claims. The weather girl
flashes teeth about a cold front
in the orange air. Every place you live,
grass child, sky child, concrete child,
the firmament is empty.

There's never enough rain 
anywhere you go.


"WILD CARTOGRAPHY"

I have places inside of me
waiting to be birthed.

Some places are little, stunted:
graves buried under a lake, ghost
towns and places void of hope.

(Hope, that border town. Hope,
that center of my every map.)

Other places are big, old:
bees were the first settlers here
and they drew people, hungry
for their honey.

Bedded on bees’ wings,
the people buried their queen
in a grave of honeycomb
and hoped.

(But hope is not breath.)

Winter is a killing time,
beestung season, Death-home.
She, Death, is another place, but
she, Death, is also a nomad.

I dream her path sometimes,
a dream of a child before she is born.

Death travels light, she travels by day
and travels by night.

My places, kept like keys
of secret locks, are not
holy or wise or even here,
but they are wild; they say
go seek me! come find me! love me!
live inside my walls.

(and walls are not unlike hope.)

Cope with a map of me,
I will: soft as fall leaves, the compass needle
rattles against my ribs.
I breathe into the sunlight,
and my shadow falls true north.


“I WISH THING WERE BETTER FOR YOU”

I realize I don’t know what better means anymore. Every choice has a negative, a consequence.
Two evils of which to be the lesser. I realize we’re all trading on the least worst possible
outcome, but never the best. The fewest bullet wounds, but never zero. The fewest entry points,
but still fewer exits. How would I name a child never meant to live longer than the length of a
breath exhaled to steady a hand? I realize I was never meant to answer that question, and I pack
my uterus in a box and bury it beneath the tree that makes me sneeze. I realize even beauty is
dangerous, and nowhere is safe, as the wind blows more pollen toward my face.


"SPRING MELT"

They separate in March:
the first of our friends

to decide on divorce.
We tiptoe around the month;

we’ve been fighting,
too. Our house is an

over-starched shirt.
The month is dark with rain,

the streets all slick
like sadness. We wait,

rarely patient, for a thaw,
for our hands to unknot

into hands again. But
our friends are an ice floe

breaking apart in spring’s
thick current. We pull

the muck of winter
from the gutters, hope

the water runs clean again;
nothing more than this:

we hold onto each other
like upturned boats—

even if cold can never
really go away, even if

we might always feel the frost
at the edges of our bodies.


"THE ANIMALS, WHICH ARE IN YOUR MOUTH"

You call the dogs, who are not gentle like wolves.
The dogs come running.
Our claws dig long graves in soft earth, throwing up thunderheads
gravid with soil.
When it rains back down, the sky’s blind sand will trace the contours
of your face and drop from your chin while the dogs worry at your feet.
You open your mouth. You spill like oil and fill our pores.
You name the animals. You fold paper into animals.
You oil our feathers and make us flightless
in the warm discontinuity of your mouth.

You call the birds. Not all birds are a product of your pale gaze,
in the hand or burning in the bush.
You bemoan the lost authenticity of the dinosaur while you allow birds
to nest in the soft crevices of your white matter. Let us peck
your eyes clean of night’s crusted honeycomb rheum
and watch it grow back by evening.

You call the bees. Note that the structural solidity of hexagons
comes from the terror of bees, turning in circles
and pushing each other away with equal and opposite force.
The comb is the shape of their mutual alienation,
a vitreous circle of prole jelly.
This is where your honey comes from.
This is a burden that won’t fit in your kipling mouth.

You call the herd, we the unintended, lowing and butting, only held together
by the dogs of your skin and the white fence of your teeth.
We are quick to infection of hoof and mouth, jostling
in the paddock of your ribs.
(Later, you’ll have to break them like a coroner to get us out.)
Our horns grew in, dexterous triple fleming tines, field and motion and current.
The field is green and dirt beneath and beneath the dirt, a gravel of dry bones.
Our hooves know only green, only forward,
Not hearing the crunch in our steps, the clutching undertow
of paper bones in the long graves in the soft earth of your mouth,
that we dug for ourselves.


“THE ABSENCE OF IT”

Shadows frighten me, lately. Shadows of my own body that I actively make. My body floating
across the top of the chair until the whole of it sits in darkness; my fingers cascading through a
bright portal of light slashed across the cherry wood of the hallway floor like a warning.
When I realize it was me, should I feel better? I don’t. I feel worse.
I pull at the skin on my lips until I taste blood, no matter how many times I tell myself I’ll stop.
When it grows back in small sheets, the edges lift up again, some sheer kind of scab, and I feel
them with my tongue, on my other lip, on his—
I can’t stand it.
I can’t stand the thought of him not being able to stand it.
I can’t stand the way my lips look on camera, mottled mauve on pale skin. There’s either blood
or the reminder of blood, but never the absence of it.
I wonder how long I would have to bleed to get there: the absence of it.


"AURORA BOREALIS"

Between clouds I looked up at the sky and down on the ground:
snow clouds, snow cover, the same above as below.
The freeze was sitting everywhere, busy at work:
its huge green needle had the whole Bering Sea to sew.

After landing we hunted Japanese soldiers for seven days.
I shared my army ration with seals at the watering hole.
I didn’t question the wisdom of it. I only saw Eskimos
and a painted top hat on the top of a totem pole.

In the hammock of fog, I was bundled up in fur coats
that swallowed up the body like the snow a heavy gun:
that’s how I lived from day to day. I hadn’t even thought
of you till yesterday evening when the patrol was done.

The light! The light! I heard the cook from the kitchen,
and when I stepped outside, there it was above the ice:
like a fluffy muslin curtain it billowed, swayed, and swung,
swimming closer and away, reminding me of something nice,

but what? I stood there pondering. Ruffled shadows were
rocking the light. With my hand on the doorknob behind,
I stared entranced. A hard voice from inside woke me up:
The door! Suddenly you spread your skirt over my mind.


"DOUSING MYSELF WITH KEROSENE"

I’m coating the walls in earl grey
and drinking Chanel no. 5
I’m dousing myself in kerosene
and eating myself alive

I’ve been carving my bones into paper
and writing with blood from my lungs
I’m dousing myself in kerosene
and burning up everyone

I’ll be singing like starlight from ashes
and collapsing the world into One
I’m dousing myself in kerosene
and imagining I am the sun


“SPECTRUM STANZA”

A day begins the way a day begins: alarm ignored, silk blocking light not blocked by other
fabric. A day begins the way most days begin: late, a rush to wake and locate myself, a crumple
to the floor on unsteady legs, frozen by the choices I give myself driven by obsession: too many
clothes from which to choose, paralyzed as promised moments tick by. A day begins the way
most days begin: drag a brush through blown-out hair meant to last all week because I cannot
hold a blow dryer for very long, powder brushed over pale face that hasn’t seen sun in days—I
stopped counting. A day begins the way a day begins: in best attempts gone untended, intentions
unmoored because it isn’t possible to moor a boat made of papier-mâché.


"WEEDS"

The danger of memory is going
to it for respite. Respite risks
entrapment. Don’t debauch
yourself by living
in some former version of yourself
that was more or less naked. Maybe
it felt better then, but you were
not better. You were smaller, as the rain
gauge must fill to the brim
with its full portion of suffering.

What can memory be in these terrible times?
Only instruction. Not a dwelling.

Or if you must dwell:
The sweet smell of weeds then.
The sweet smell of weeds now.
An endurance. A standoff. A rest.


"THERE IS A FORCE THAT BREAKS THE BODY"

There is a force that breaks the body, inevitable,
the by-product is pain, unexceptional as a rain
gauge, which has become arcane, rhyme, likewise,
unless it’s assonant or internal injury, gloom, joy,
which is also a dish soap, but not the one that rids
seabirds of oil from wrecked tankers, that’s Dawn,
which should change its name to Dusk, irony being
the flip side of sentimentality here in the Iron Age,
ironing out the kinks in despair, turning it to hairdo
from hair, to do, vexing infinitive, much better to be
pain’s host, body of Christ as opposed to the Holy
Ghost, when I have been suffering at times I could
step away from it by embracing it, a blues thing,
a John Donne thing, divest by wrestling, then sing.


"SILENCE IS SO ACCURATE, ROTHKO WROTE"

Accurate like an arrow without a target
and no target in mind.

Silence has its own roar or, not-roar,
just as Rothko wrote “I don’t express myself
in my paintings. I express my not-self.”

A poem that expresses the not-self.
Everything but the self.
The meadow’s veil of fog, but is veil self-referential?

Already, dawn, the not-birds alert to what silence has to offer.

The fog, one of Rothko’s shapes,
hanging there in the not-self, humming.

Mikel, before he died, loved Rothko most.
When he could still think, he put his mind
to those sorts of judgments.

If I pull the fog away like theater curtains, what then?

Sadness shapes the landscape.
The arrow of myself thwacks the nearest tree.
Fog steps closer like a perpetrator or a god.

Oh. I’m weeping.
Tears feed the silence like a mother drops
into her baby not-bird’s open beak

some sweet but dangerous morsel.


"WHERE DOES IT LIVE?"

Where does it live?
you would ask me.
Saucer, cup, spoon—
which shelf, which drawer.
“You might not come home…”
I know, you said.
Three paramedics
had just burst in.
 
Everything had
to have its spot:
book, shirt, key, shoe.
Where does it live?
pen, tape, plug, file.
They picked you up.
Nail, wrench, hammer, awl.
They carried you out.
 
I grabbed my coat.
For a moment
an unhinged storm:
knives leapt from drawers,
extension cords
pliers, screwdrivers
from cabinet doors:
bowls, pots, towels,
paperclips, Band-Aids…
 
Where do we live?
Where do we live?
As plastic containers flew,
I slammed the door
and ran toward you.
Where do you live?
 
And after a long
time, I returned.
Like excited pets
who’d finally settled,
they’d slipped back
to their shelves and slept
for their doors were shut
when I entered alone.


"COMMUNISM AND TALKING WITH GHOSTS"

From their high places, the hawks stalk
toddlers and leer down at the ghost
of Marcus Aurelius screeching and
bubbling mad purple geometries,
chanted scars etched into young brains:
“I’m cicadas swarming, I’m flame,
I’m a four-and-a-half-hour erection!
I’m a rotted oak filigreed with vine,
I’m asteroid impact, I’m astral projection!”
He’s like this all the time. He pretends it’s falling
into water that shuts his eyes. The hawks
unblinking and him watching them back.
He gnaws a stalk of wheatgrass. He says
“Being dead is as stoic as you can get,”
and the way he says it sounds like a threat.
The raptors chorus and pick
off the smallest and sickly
as the children riot and disperse.
See? Things are never as bad
as they seem. They are worse.


“AUTISM VERSE”

I learned that when other people say time is a flat circle they’re joking around, having a bit of
fun. They don’t mean it the way I do—that everything repeats because it’s all happening again
and for the first time and the twentieth time all at once, that we can never fully understand the
meaning of time, a word we invented to name a concept even the smartest of us can’t nail down.
I learned that some biological part of me will always want a baby, and that she’ll sneak into my
dreams and try to change my mind, even though I am an unwoman. I learned and relearned that
stress can make me violently ill and that one single friend who understands can be the difference
between life and death. I learned that if I choose life—because it is always a choice that requires
making—I have to choose it every day. And the next day. And again. And again. I learned that
the choice never stays made, no matter how set it might feel. I learned that tomorrow, everything
will be different and the same and new and old and right and wrong all over again, because time
is a flat circle.


"HELLO, I MUST BE GOING"

When we finally took her cigarettes away
Nana tried to smoke chicken bones, lighting
each gnarled end with matches we forgot to
check her pocket for. “You’re a sweetie” was
her mantra, repeated like her old blue parakeet
she forgot to feed, and it died slowly, like the
smile from her face as she sat in
the blue velour chair, staring out the front window
like she was watching a Garbo movie.
When we came to bring her groceries,
those bags like birthday presents,
she would hike up her sweat pants
like an umpire contemplating a play and
wander to the kitchen, her fingers playing with the
edge of her t-shirt, and peer through
blue eyes, as clean as a slate, as we pulled
cans of fruit cocktail and snack cakes magic-like from
brown paper sacks. She had the looks of Marilyn,
never left the house in any shoes but heels, even
ironed Boompa’s boxers until her mind moved on and
forgot to leave a note. When we came over today
she looked through me like I was a pane of glass. My
face like one she saw once in a magazine ad,
or in the crowd at St. John’s Sunday mass.
She asked me who I was, her voice like the hello you
speak into the phone, distant and hollow like she
was across a lake. The glimmer of recognition in
her face like a dying ember stoked for the last time
before burning out altogether. She put her hands
up to her ashen face, devoid of the makeup she
caked on like Tammy Faye, and felt for her once pretty
eyes, that broke a hundred hearts, as they betrayed
her with tears, splashing down her face, surprising her
like rain on someone else’s cheeks.


"THE GODDESS OF LAYING WORDS DOWN ONE BY ONE"

I whisper them, my prayers to her. I pace them out,
an iambic limp, from room to room to door to wind.
That wind blows through me, as it should. I’m gaping
with holes.

Holy holes, but hollow. Hallowed holes but fallow.
The wind curls in and out of them, chill then warm,
filling and emptying each gap. Oh, I can wax rhapsodic
but shallow.

This is the hard news: we have lost everything we thought
was certain. We have to rebuild, here in the barrens,
with our only tools our hands. Lay bricks down, word by word
for shelter.

Sheltering bricks, but battered. Scattered bricks and tattered.
The wind pools and pours, thin then thick, mortaring each gap
with toil and prayer. Building, building. We will regain it all. Each
syllable matters.


“STILLNESS OF TIME”

I think about the effort it takes to walk from the living room to the kitchen, to twist my mouth into one
expression after another. I ask, If energy cannot be created or destroyed, will I run out before I can ever
smile at my wrinkles in the mirror? I think probably not. I can see the wrinkles already. I ask her, Are
wrinkles good or bad? She says, Yes. That’s enough for now. She catches the sun in a jar and puts the jar
in a box she hides under her bed. She says, Not yet. She says, Hold on for one more morning. She says,
Let the sun bloom into a moment of stillness.


"IN THE LIBRARY"

There's a book called
'A Dictionary of Angels.'
No one has opened it in fifty years,
I know, because when I did,
The covers creaked, the pages
Crumbled. There I discovered

The angels were once as plentiful
As species of flies.
The sky at dusk
Used to be thick with them.
You had to wave both arms
Just to keep them away.

Now the sun is shining
Through the tall windows.
The library is a quiet place.
Angels and gods huddled
In dark unopened books.
The great secret lies
On some shelf Miss Jones
Passes every day on her rounds.

She's very tall, so she keeps
Her head tipped as if listening.
The books are whispering.
I hear nothing, but she does.


"HOURGLASS"

Give me back the days when I was the beach
and you were the ocean, kissing me but tasting sand;
would you please churn your deep volcanoes
and give me those pearls you stole?


"THE STORY THAT THE SMALL THINGS TELL"

Back in the fields that I came from,
I danced with a deer mask on.
I was a brave and bloody thing.

I was full of teeth and tongue and tendons
And when the red sun rose,
I was realer than any animal,
Realer than the cows that watched me
With eyes like tapioca pearls.
Realer than the pigs that would eat my body,
Given the chance.

I want to haunt
Old buildings in the dark again
With the sound of my stomping.
To become the animal-god
That could eat my tiny body
And forget it ever knew
How to be afraid.


"THESEUS' DISTANCE"
 
See the map –
these pins are me.
 
Stainless anchors, their weighted hooks, hooked
to scatterplot events
on a plane, not a line.
 
There is no great circle,
no calculated best fit to drag me around or niche me.
 
The dots are ways to measure
Theseus’ distance –
the distance between now and before,
what is and what it came from.
 
A steel bar,
its atoms split and rolled.
 
So many heads
thinking this is home;
all of them wrong.
 
Home is a finite point,
in the middle of the fault-line.

 
"YOU GO EVERY DIRECTION IN AN ELEVATOR"

 
from the anvil’s head
you loose your lightning tongue –
thunder speaks for you.

We stand soaking in the shower, cedar wet beneath our feet, red bricks turning brown as down the rain falls, down each other’s wet mouths, our strident tongues, past walls of smiling teeth that draw blood when nobody’s watching. This is still the movie moment, the one where you lift your uncontainable heel, where a windblown strand of your hair parts our laughing lips, where I still love you in your white dress spattered with red flowers. But we have to go inside, and while we rise together the soft elevator drops my stomach, knowing when the doors part they’re actually closing. And we’re done.

the empty sound burns,
hollows out my secret space –
white hot ghost scars


"AFTERIMAGES"

The woman in the photograph
stands in the foreground
of some blurred landscape,
nameless and tree-full.

She is looking away, collar
turned up, crows floating
in mid-air like question marks.

Behind her, fox prints mark
the snow’s drifts,
or maybe they are only flaws,
afterimages in the sepia.
I want them to be fox prints.

Standing in the vintage shop
I wonder how she arrived here,
what careless family lost this heirloom.
I’d conjure a whole life for her
but she’s already inhabited.

I hold it so long that the pale gold
seeps out of the photograph
and stains my fingers
as I wonder over and over again
how long it’s been since her lungs
drank in that snow-bright air
and where she’s gone,
whether she crawled into the fox
and ran off to consume
a whole forest.


"AND X-RAY VISION TO FIND THE BEER"
 
My father is a superhero,
has no special powers,
wears glasses for nearsightedness,
dons jumpsuits for car repairs,
hangs his hat with reluctance,
works around the clock,
gets injured and carries on,
drinks wine because it tastes good,
guards his emotions with distance,
is only there if you need him.


"MEMORY IS A TELESCOPE"

On Facebook my sister-in-law discovers a photograph of the house
where she and my husband grew up. Towering sycamores

dwarf the roofline. He recalls he dug the holes deep,
tamped down rich loam. She doesn’t remember planting trees.

Memory is a telescope—it gathers light from dead stars,
pinpoints the timeworn farmhouse ten miles from town

—no neighbors, no fences. As gray as loneliness,
sagging curtains shroud narrow windows.

Focus reset, the telescope magnifies dust-motes
adrift in my husband’s sweltering attic bedroom—

miniature galaxies spin through twin beams from windows
close-set like roosters’ eyes. Under the peaked roof we sleep

among relics: Father’s accordion—fire-engine red, keys yellow
like the old man’s teeth. Mother’s treadle sewing machine,

her mother’s buxom Victorian manequin.
In a cardboard box of dog-eared snapshots

ancestors beg to be named.
The telescope zooms in on edgy face-offs

like freeze-frames in a black & white movie.
In one shoebox bedroom sisters butt heads;

in the other, Father harangues Mother.
The house hisses—a kettle about to boil over.

Muggy days, mind-numbing as after-school detentions,
sweaty nights, dank sheets, mosquitoes’ whine…

At the vanishing point where our telescopes lose resolution
my husband’s memories converge with mine.
 

"PINEBLOODED"

My ashes pump wingless blood,
green and brown and unfamiliar,
through channels spanning
out, from my central year
out, to the new soft flesh
beneath the cracked iron of my skin,
my knotted feet go nowhere,
mirror my exultant, upward stretch,
a hundred thin fingers fluttering
above the subtle shift
of my mighty wooden spine
in the savage wet spring wind,
I bend and bow and spread
seeds, umber bombs of beauty,
the clouds my constant gods
bestowing rain and stealing sun,
and this life, no different than before.


"CAT'S CRADLE STRETCHED ACROSS TIME"

Perhaps, when we remember wars, we should take off our clothes and paint ourselves blue and go on all fours all day long and grunt like pigs. That would surely be more appropriate than noble oratory and shows of flags and well-oiled guns. Artists use frauds to make human beings seem more wonderful than they really are. Dancers show us human beings who move much more gracefully than human beings really move. Films and books and plays show us people talking much more entertainingly than people really talk, make paltry human enterprises seem important. Singers and musicians show us human beings making sounds far more lovely than human beings really make. Architects give us temples in which something marvelous is obviously going on. Actually, practically nothing is going on. I've often thought there ought to be a manual to hand to little kids, telling them what kind of planet they're on, why they don't fall off it, how much time they've probably got here, how to avoid poison ivy, and so on. I tried to write one once. It was called Welcome to Earth. But I got stuck on explaining why we don't fall off the planet. Gravity is just a word. It doesn't explain anything. If I could get past gravity, I'd tell them how we reproduce, how long we've been here, apparently, and a little bit about evolution. I didn't learn until I was in college about all the other cultures, and I should have learned that in the first grade. A first grader should understand that his or her culture isn't a rational invention; that there are thousands of other cultures and they all work pretty well; that all cultures function on faith rather than truth; that there are lots of alternatives to our own society. Cultural relativity is defensible and attractive. It's also a source of hope. It means we don't have to continue this way if we don't like it. The things other people have put into my head, at any rate, do not fit together nicely, are often useless and ugly, are out of proportion with one another, are out of proportion with life as it really is outside my head. People took such awful chances with chemicals and their bodies because they wanted the quality of their lives to improve. They lived in ugly places where there were only ugly things to do. They didn't own doodley-squat, so they couldn't improve their surroundings. so they did their best to make their insides beautiful instead.


"POSTLUDE"

The human swansong is radioactive,
bleeding out the afterlife
in decay
of full-bodied isotopes,
of thin-bodied corpses,
of animal bones
touched by the godforce
of a single metal raindrop—

it was pewter-colored cancer
growing on the face of the sky,
screaming
toward the ground—

a requiem
of light and the darkness of tombs
marked by untouched dinner plates
and interlocked knots of skeletons,
marked by flowers on rooftops
and deer grazing in the living room,
marked by snowing statues of ash
forever in the middle of something.


"ENTOMOMANCY"

Martha raises centipedes, divines
the weather from shed skin.
It’s going to be a harsh winter.
I don’t question what remains,

know better than to look for answers
in the dust any more than the decay.
Martha opens a book of fungi, points
to each illustration, dripping down

the page. It’s raining now. She tells me,
this spindly one will only kill you
if you are a poor host. So I practice
setting the table for ten, polishing

the good China, pouring the wine.
Martha takes me foraging for worms.
She dips a hand into wet soil
as easily as into shadow, returns

with half a dozen worms reading her palm.
They scrutinize her lifeline, and Martha smiles,
lets them back down to the earth, tells me
there are yet other ways of becoming, and still
it’s raining, so I believe her. I do.


"SWANS"

Your shirt was black-crow, like
your hair, like
your boots and the secrets they carried,
but your smile-sound was ten suns –
a million lux exploding
at once, too much to hold in
a single mouth, you shared yours with me
in frets and wet, pink, strawberry muscle,
sharp like a war-needle
in my throat, the wind spoke silent oaths –
and for all the stars between your lips,
I did not see the shadows,
the circling birds, I could not augur
the weather of weapons, and you,
you did not hear, you roared
your own black song in the red wound-sea,
and began the long swim from your bath
down the swan-road,
and the dress you wore was black-crow, like
my mouth.

"ODYSSEUS"

I can see your room only with my eyes closed now—
that’s how little I understand anything at all—and you
sitting up as I entered, and in one motion you throwing
off your nightgown, cornflowers and flannel, and the moment
catching your hair’s wildness in an insolent shrug,
and then I was Odysseus naked before Nausicaä—but no
you were naked—I was merely doomed, and I moved
as into the twilight of a cave, like a man loving his own
ruin, happy for his wounds and happy for the wounds
to come. Maybe a spark jumped, but there is no name
for the god of fragments—there was just a fire I believed in.
And there is still a fire that I believe in. Like the nymph,
incandescent in the glade, from whom the man should have
run in terror instead of begging her to renounce her
godliness in the name of carnal love. Still, there were
old men once in their robes and togas who were wise and
famously schooled by a woman, and they told us that
everything here is a shadow of something else—like a song
plucked on strings that implies two bodies dancing in an
ecstasy beyond all earthly knowing. Where is your bed
now? Your prodigal body that whole polities might worship?
In what world? That is what I am asking, love. What world?


"BEDTIME STORY"

I talked to Mom today,
you don’t remember her,
but you birthed her sometime 70 years ago, anyway
she told me you were dying,
and I’m grateful you probably don’t remember
the doctor, leaning close to the nurse, whispering,
“Six months, max.”

You’re retaining water;
modern medicine says your kidneys are shutting down,
that your heart is failing,
but I think the water is just a substitute
for the weight of lost memories –
don’t worry,
I have so many.

Let me tell you:
one time, we picked up metal scraps in the alley –
Dad melted them down at work,
cut and carved them into a magic amulet –
on the way we battled comic book villains,
and at night we cut out our own monsters,
and taped them to the wall to scare away nightmares.

The paper monsters don’t work anymore,
I’m too old and they’ve gotten too smart
with their fees and paperwork and responsibilities –
I want to come visit,
but some pirates took my money, and Mom is busy
trying to forget you with her credit card
and she started a new exercise routine of running away.

I want to play a game. Go hide, hide as best you can,
in a place God himself couldn’t find you –
someplace better than a grave, no,
and ditch the hospital gown –
go hide in our history, let the water disappear,
and I’ll send you stories you won’t remember.
Let me start with the time you didn’t die.


"NIMBUS ARCHIPELAGO"

I.         We are taught to hallucinate from a young age –
           imagine friends or a fat white elephant in the sky,
           build mansions, castles in the air –  
           ideas, so impossible.
                   
                       “One day,” we say,
                       playing doctor in the grass of the ditch,
                       “we’ll own an island, we’ll own all the islands,
                       not the ones between continents of debt and depression,
                       no, the ones sailing the infinite blue above our heads;
                       we’ll grow cotton candy, construct groundscrapers,
                       use lightning in our table lamps,
                       travel together using polished chrome jetpacks.”      

II.       There’s a fine line
           between creativity and insanity, between dreams
           and the pipes they leak from –
           even the heavens have plumbing problems.
           

                       “Get under the umbrella,” I say,
                       watching you dance, words drowned out by the rain,
                       “don’t blame me if you catch your death,
                       I’m out of chicken soup and apologies.”
                       But you are already dissolving
                       like a cowboy in the sunset, except you don’t ride
                       toward any known horizon; you just grin,
                       “It’s just a little water,” and don’t leave so much as a hat.

III.      “I still don’t believe in ghosts,” I say,
           feeling your laugh before I hear it –
           the flash and then the thunder –  “Then what are clouds?
           Don’t you see their restless shift? Ancestors, childhoods,
           reduced to bone and vapor, suspended
           foundations, waiting to be built upon.”
           Silence returns, and I feel the ectoplasm –
           it smells like ozone but feels like the map of your skin.

                       The aftertaste of loss is a lot like waking up: fragments,
                       black, alone – the nimbus archipelago crawls
                       across the broken anatomy of sky
                        with the tenderness of vinegar.


"SLEEP WELL BEAST"

We've been stuck out here in the hallway for way way too long
I'm at a loss, I'm at a loss. I'm losing grip. The fabric's ripped
Go back to sleep, let me drive, let me think, let me figure it out
How to get us back to the place where we were when we first went out
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
Losing parents, losing sense
I don't know what we should do
Became a father when I was still a son, she brings it out in you
See you at the end of the party with your wild white eyes
Filling up the teacup with gin in your secret postcard life
I'll tell you about it some time, the time we left
We leave our saviors wrapped around the necks of new machines
Or at the ends of threads that hold their bodies to the ground
And then the men who look a little like they felt like me
Offered them some bottled water, then they cut them down
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different
Your voice was low, you blended in, I could barely hear you speak
You were always my last second bright spot in the distance
Thought that you were something good
That I would always keep
I'll still destroy you some day, sleep well beast, you as well, beast


"NOBODY ELSE WILL BE THERE"

You said we're not so tied together
What did you mean?
Meet me in the stairwell in a second
For a glass of gin
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Can you remind me the building you live in
I'm on my way
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous
It's a subway day
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Why are we still out here?
Holding our coats
We look like children
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
Hey baby, where were you back then?
When I needed your hand
I thought that when I stuck my neck out
I'd get you out of your shell
My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever
I need you alone
Goodbyes always take us half an hour
Can't we just go home?
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there
Nobody else will be there then
Nobody else will be there


"AMBASSADOR"

We speak now or I do, and others do. You've never spoken before. You will. You'll be able to say how the city is a pit and a hill and a standard and an animal that hunts and a vessel on the sea and the sea and how we are fish in it, not like the man who swims weekly with fish but the fish with which he swims, the water, the pool. I love you, you light me, warm me, you are suns. You have never spoken before. I don't want to be a simile anymore. I want to be a metaphor. Being a child is like nothing. It's only being. Later, when we think about it, we make it into youth. 


"BURNT NORTON"

 Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation.
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden. My words echo
Thus, in your mind.
                              But to what purpose
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
I do not know.
                        Other echoes
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,
Round the corner. Through the first gate,
Into our first world, shall we follow
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
There they were, dignified, invisible,
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,
And the bird called, in response to
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,
To look down into the drained pool.
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,
The surface glittered out of heart of light,
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind
Cannot bear very much reality.
Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.

Garlic and sapphires in the mud
Clot the bedded axle-tree.
The trilling wire in the blood
Sings below inveterate scars
Appeasing long forgotten wars.
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars
Ascend to summer in the tree
We move above the moving tree
In light upon the figured leaf
And hear upon the sodden floor
Below, the boarhound and the boar
Pursue their pattern as before
But reconciled among the stars.

At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
But neither arrest nor movement. And do not call it fixity,
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.
The inner freedom from the practical desire,
The release from action and suffering, release from the inner
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,
Erhebung without motion, concentration
Without elimination, both a new world
And the old made explicit, understood
In the completion of its partial ecstasy,
The resolution of its partial horror.
Yet the enchainment of past and future
Woven in the weakness of the changing body,
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
Which flesh cannot endure.
                                          Time past and time future
Allow but a little consciousness.
To be conscious is not to be in time
But only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,
The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
Be remembered; involved with past and future.
Only through time time is conquered.

Here is a place of disaffection
Time before and time after
In a dim light: neither daylight
Investing form with lucid stillness
Turning shadow into transient beauty
With slow rotation suggesting permanence
Nor darkness to purify the soul
Emptying the sensual with deprivation
Cleansing affection from the temporal.
Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
Over the strained time-ridden faces
Distracted from distraction by distraction
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
Tumid apathy with no concentration
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind
That blows before and after time,
Wind in and out of unwholesome lungs
Time before and time after.
Eructation of unhealthy souls
Into the faded air, the torpid
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Not here
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.

    Descend lower, descend only
Into the world of perpetual solitude,
World not world, but that which is not world,
Internal darkness, deprivation
And destitution of all property,
Desiccation of the world of sense,
Evacuation of the world of fancy,
Inoperancy of the world of spirit;
This is the one way, and the other
Is the same, not in movement
But abstention from movement; while the world moves
In appetency, on its metalled ways
Of time past and time future.

Time and the bell have buried the day,
The black cloud carries the sun away.
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray
Clutch and cling?

    Chill
Fingers of yew be curled
Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing
Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still
At the still point of the turning world.

Words move, music moves
Only in time; but that which is only living
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,
Can words or music reach
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still
Moves perpetually in its stillness.
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,
Not that only, but the co-existence,
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,
And the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end.
And all is always now. Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,
Always assail them. The Word in the desert
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.

    The detail of the pattern is movement,
As in the figure of the ten stairs.
Desire itself is movement
Not in itself desirable;
Love is itself unmoving,
Only the cause and end of movement,
Timeless, and undesiring
Except in the aspect of time
Caught in the form of limitation
Between un-being and being.
Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
Even while the dust moves
There rises the hidden laughter
Of children in the foliage
Quick now, here, now, always—
Ridiculous the waste sad time
Stretching before and after.


"HEAD OF A WOMAN WITH THE HORNS OF A RAM"

I used to curse the sidewalk ice
when I walked downhill after midnight,
my voice a bachelor in the quiet
wedded to itself, with a dog

warming its feet. A dog who never hunted,
never bit into deer or fox
felled. After Actaeon was changed
into a buck and his own dogs ran him down—
he knew them each by name, dozens

of them, names like Daisy, and Slayer, too—
Ovid says he made a sound no man
would make, and no stag either.
Today I went to my campus office

for the first time in such a long time, I even saw
a few students, and we laughed, almost
enchanted by each other’s bodies: human,
fully ourselves, outside a screen.
I have two copies of The Metamorphoses there,
 
and one has spent the pandemic by the window.
Same edition, same cover—Head of a Woman
with the Horns of a Ram—but that one
has been lying out, changing in the sun,

bleached purple like a bruise almost healed.
Both girls have their cheeks to their shoulders,
as if to soothe some itch, but they can’t tell
where just yet. Both girls are in trouble,
but one has been lonelier.


"YOUNGER AND DUMBER"

When I was younger
Younger and dumber
Built like a flower
You came to pick me from out of the city
You turned me sour

When I was younger
Younger and prouder
I was nobody
You came to hurt me in all the right places
Made me somebody

Which way will I run when I want something new?
I don't feel at home in this house anymore
Which way will I run when I'm over you?
I don't feel at home in this town

Sometimes I just don't wanna be alone
And it's not cause I'm lonely
It's just 'cause I get so tired of filling the space all around me
And the love I feel is so powerful it can take you anywhere
And the love I feel is so very real that it'll drag you down

Which way will I run when I want something new?
I don't feel at home in this house anymore
Which way will I run when I'm over you?
I don't feel at home in this town

When I was younger
Younger and dumber
I didn't know better 


"THE MOON IS NO GOOD"

I look my best when I say what I mean
Don't push me out of mind
I do my best on Saturdays
Leave the rest of the week behind

I'm out of control and I blame it on the moon
I'm off the hook this time
I'm good to drive with a tainted mind
Let me drop you off in paradise
I'm good to drive you anywhere you need to be
You're gone even when you don't leave

I'm out of control and I blame it on the moon
I'm off the hook this time
I'm out of control, wouldn't blame it on you
I just wouldn't feel right


"ALL OF THIS WILL END"

Inside my cage I watch the clouds
Getting angry, turning dark and raining down
I let my fingers run
I want to turn my brain off, want to turn my shame to dust
Nobody hears me now
I'm talking to myself, I'm talking to god or something
I don't want anything to do with magic

And back then I had it
Forgiving and sacred

You ask me what I think about this
Is there's even a reason for it?
I don't have answers, no one does
I've been finding comfort in that
There's only love
There's only moving through and trying your best
Sometimes it's not enough
Who gives a fuck? All of this will end

Don't forget
All of this will end

I'm out of body
I am idle in the kitchen biting on my fingernails
Keeping from calling
Feeling scared of everyone I thought I knew
I'm only loving
Only moving through and trying my best
Sometimes it's not enough
But I'm still real, and I forgive 


"WOODEN HEART"

We're all born to broken people on their most honest day of living and since that first breath… We'll need grace that we've never given I've been haunted by standard red devils and white ghosts and it's not only when these eyes are closed these lies are ropes that I tie down in my stomach, but they hold this ship together tossed like leaves in this weather and my dreams are sails that I point towards my true north, stretched thin over my rib bones, and pray that it gets better but it won't won't, at least I don't believe it will… so I've built a wooden heart inside this iron ship, to sail these blood red seas and find your coasts. don't let these waves wash away your hopes this war-ship is sinking, and I still believe in anchors pulling fist fulls of rotten wood from my heart, I still believe in saviors but I know that we are all made out of shipwrecks, every single board washed and bound like crooked teeth on these rocky shores so come on and let's wash each other with tears of joy and tears of grief and fold our lives like crashing waves and run up on this beach come on and sew us together, tattered rags stained forever we only have what we remember


"BOOKENDS"

Time it was
And what a time it was, it was
A time of innocence
A time of confidences

Long ago it must be
I have a photograph
Preserve your memories
They're all that's left you 


"STATE HOSPITAL"

The half back-flip conception, a state hospital birth
The most threadbare tall story the country's ever heard
Brought home to breathe smoke in arms of her mother with a blunt kitchen knife
Who just lays in a submissive position
beneath the national weight and the slow arc of a fist

Her heart beats like a breeze block thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete forced to be brave she was, born into a grave

And in the limp three years of board schooling
she's accustomed to hearing that she could never run far
A slipped disc in the spine of community,
a bloody curse word made pedestrian verse
Spirits in graveyards and fingers in car parks
She cries in the high street just to be heard
A screaming anchor for nothing in particular
at the foot of the fuck of it, and dragging her heels in the dirt

Her heart beats like a breeze block thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete forced to be brave she was, born into a grave

The cheek of youth flushed red and turned gray
Now she lies on the pavement, she's helped to her feet,
all thighs, hair, and magpie handbags
Saturday's uniform for the fuck me parade
Brought home to keep warm in the arms of a plumber ruddy and balding
Who just needs a spine to dig into, a chest for the head, and a hand for the holding

Her heart beats like a breeze block thrown down the stairs
Her blood is thicker than concrete forced to be brave she was, she was

Her heart beats like a breeze block thrown down the stairs
Her skin is thicker than concrete forced to be brave she was, she was
A broken elevator anthem held between floors
But if blood is thicker than concrete, all of it is not lost


"LYRIC IN THE SPRAWL OF WOUND"

The Christians are playing
their anvils again
outside the Planned Parenthood

& like the clanging things
I too am black &
have been wrought

& so I grab a mallet
to beat myself & feel
what it’s like to be heard

& the mallet can’t believe
what it’s been asked to do
& the sound I make

is out of tune & untamed,
is reverb & flame
the way riot is flame,

the way bloom & bud
& blood are flame &
when they stop their play

to watch me like I am the sun
and might do anything to anyone,
I realize this is the only way to live.

To put your voice to song
and wrap the song in fire.
That is what is required.


"DEATH DREAM"

It was dawn and the kitchen light was still on
I stepped in and found a suicide asleep on the floor
An open mouth, screams and makes no sound
Apart from the ring of the tinnitus of silence
You had your ear to the ground

White noise
I don't know if there's breathing or not
Butterflied arms, tell me that this one has flown
Blood seems black against the skin on your porcelain back
A still life is the last I will see of you, my painting of a panic attack

You died in my sleep last night...
You died in your sleep last night...

Death dreams I don't forget
It's been a while since I dreamed this
Even now when I sleep I tread with care


"THE RUNNING OF SEVERAL SIMULATIONS AT ONCE MAY LEAD TO MURKY DATA"

How do you say ‘inopportune’
in a small forest of cell phone towers
disguised as bizarrely regular trees?
I am asking in case it happens,
because anything can and even does.
Sometimes I want to shrink
and move into a miniature model village
mostly because the particular green
of the imaginary grass corresponds
with how my body believes joy would feel
if joy were to happen here on Earth,
where my eyes receive light in this
certain way: limited, but not
without pleasure. As a child
I visited one model village
so extensively constructed I fell
into a state of complete wonder—
‘They thought of everything!’
even the person running late
for the train, and the window
left slightly open to the storm—
and I should like to request
the arrival of this sensation in response
to the world at its actual scale—
just imagine! Someone
has even gone to the trouble
of filling the egg cartons
individually with smooth brown
eggs and one—such detail!—
has broken, but not enough
to be noticed before the carton
has been paid for and brought home.
Sometimes artificially I will
induce this feeling in myself
by going silent at a large
restaurant gathering, pretending
—until it is real—that each person
is speaking from a highly naturalistic script,
having carefully rehearsed each
tiny gesture, the mid-sentence reach
for the salt, and I fall immediately
in love with my companions,
in awe of their remarkable talent
for portraying with such detailed conviction
the humans I know as my friends.



"IF YOU GO INTO THE WOODS YOU WILL FIND IT HAS A TECHNOLOGY"

This tree has a small LED display 
It is glowing and it can show you words 
and it can show you pictures and it can melt 
from one choice to another and you are looking at it 
and it wants you to share the message 
but it can't see that you are the only one around 
and that everyone else is hibernating 
which you love You are so happy and alone 
with the red and yellow lights It's a nice day 
to be in nature and to read up on the very bland ideas 
this tree has about how to live This tree says 
grow stronger and this tree says fireworks effect 
This tree is the saddest prophet in history 
but you don't tell it that You are trying to show it respect 
which gets tiresome but then it flashes 
a snake at you It's a kind of LED tree hybrid joke 
and you could just kiss it for trying For failing
But it can't see you and it starts to cry


"HALF OMEN HALF HOPE"

When everything finally has been wrecked and further shipwrecked,
When their most ardent dream has been made hollow and unrecognizable,
They will feel inside their limbs the missing shade of blue that lingers
Against hills in the cooler hours before dark, and the moss at the foot of the forest
When green starts to leave it. What they take into their privacy (half of his embrace,
Her violence at play) are shadows of acts which have no farewells in them.
Moons unearth them. And when, in their separate dwellings, their bodies
Feel the next season come, they no longer have anyone to whom
To tell it. Clouds of reverie pass outside the window and a strange emptiness
Peers back in. If they love, it is solely to be adored, it is to scatter and gather
Themselves like hard seeds in a field made fallow by a fire someone years ago set.
In the quiet woods, from the highest trees, there is always something
Weightless falling; and he, who must realize that certain losses are irreparable,
Tells himself at night, before the darkest mirror, that vision keeps him whole.

On the verge of warm and simple sleep they tell themselves certain loves
Are like sheets of dark water, or ice forests, or husks of ships. To stop a thing
Such as this would be to halve a sound that travels out from a silent person’s
Thoughts. The imprint they make on each other’s bodies is worth any pain
They may have caused. Quiet falls around them. And when she reaches
For him the air greens like underwater light and the well-waters drop.
They will see again the shadows of insects.
They will touch the bark and feel each age of the tree fly undisturbed
Into them. If what is no longer present in them cannot be restored,
It can at least be offered. Through long bewildered dusks, stalks grow;
Rains fill and pass out of clouds; animals hover at the edges of fields
With eyes like black pools. For nothing cannot be transformed;
Pleasure and failure feed each other daily. Do not think any breeze,
Any grain of light, shall be withheld. All the stars will sail out for them.


"IN LIEU OF WILDFIRES"

There is so little to call ours except caution,
a little myth, the pan

of stuffed duck cooling on
the counter. I zip myself into bed. My grandmother

wakes up at 4 am to exercise. Call it an exercise
in faith, how she bets on dawn. Meanwhile

Mama colors her white hairs. Then she stands
before the topography of unwashed dishes

and breathes with her chest. The tomatoes
are ripe now. Go look–they’re growing out the garden,

in the pot with a peace sign
tattooed in the clay. The mothers I miss

shrug off their jackets, leave them folded
by my door. I cut off any loose threads,

heat them up with my palms, & cling.
When I look up, the sun is gone. Remember

to never leave visions unattended.
I mistake California in fall for

apocalypse. The clovers here have
too many leaves to count.


"FROM NIGHT SKY"

White sky. Rain ices and lands as perfect quiet.
You have driven days to be here. You did not expect
such light in the ice—all through the town the hour
understands and goes its way. Above the treeline, ceaselessly,
mountains—halfway up the rock snow-steam gathers
and weaves. Town be still as the day finds an order.
Order understand the hour glass-white on the fields.
Cars, pass the people in houses and see what little
they live for. A breath on the window close to the face,
and beyond it, wind lifting snow.


"THE STARRY NIGHT"

The town does not exist
except where one black-haired tree slips
up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.
The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars.   
Oh starry starry night! This is how
I want to die.

It moves. They are all alive.
Even the moon bulges in its orange irons   
to push children, like a god, from its eye.
The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.   
Oh starry starry night! This is how   
I want to die:

into that rushing beast of the night,   
sucked up by that great dragon, to split   
from my life with no flag,
no belly,
no cry.


"PLANETARIUM"

A woman in the shape of a monster   
a monster in the shape of a woman   
the skies are full of them

a woman      ‘in the snow
among the Clocks and instruments   
or measuring the ground with poles’

in her 98 years to discover   
8 comets

she whom the moon ruled   
like us
levitating into the night sky   
riding the polished lenses

Galaxies of women, there
doing penance for impetuousness   
ribs chilled

An eye,

             Tycho whispering at last

What we see, we see   
and seeing is changing

the light that shrivels a mountain   
and leaves a man alive

Heartbeat of the pulsar
heart sweating through my body

The radio impulse   
pouring in from Taurus

         I am bombarded yet         I stand

I have been standing all my life in the   
direct path of a battery of signals
the most accurately transmitted most   
untranslatable language in the universe
I am a galactic cloud so deep      so invo-

years to travel through me       And has

of a woman trying to translate pulsations   
into images    for the relief of the body   
and the reconstruction of the mind.


"WAVES 1"

I want someone to sit beside 
after the day's pursuit and all its anguish, 
after its listening, and its waitings, 
and its suspicions. After quarrelling 
and reconciliation I need privacy - 
to be alone with you, to set this hubbub in order. 
For I am as neat as a cat in my habits.


"WAVES 2"

There is, then, a world immune from change. But I am not composed enough, standing on tiptoe on the verge of fire, still scorched by the hot breath, afraid of the door opening and the leap of the tiger, to make even one sentence. What I say is perpetually contradicted. Each time the door opens I am interrupted. I am not yet twenty-one. I am to be broken. I am to be derided all my life. I am to be cast up and down among these men and women, with their twitching faces, with their lying tongues, like a cork on a rough sea. Like a ribbon of weed I am flung far every time the door opens. I am the foam that sweeps and fills the uttermost rims of the rocks with whiteness; I am also a girl, here in this room.


"WAVES 3"

But for pain words are lacking. There should be cries, cracks, fissures, whiteness passing over chintz covers, interference with the sense of time, of space; the sense also of extreme fixity in passing objects; and sounds very remote and then very close; flesh being gashed and blood spurting, a joint suddenly twisted - beneath all of which appears something very important, yet remote, to be just held in solitude.


"BRANCHING LIFE"

I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.


"OLD MATH"

I feel a shunning in my sleeping hours—
the violence of no—
when he who shouldn’t does, 
before I knew what longing was. 

I grew into myself before I was ready,
my girl’s mouth forming a zero.
Oh the turning away, the echo in every no,
which shaped and became me—

not like a new dress to try on—no,
more like a second skin. Each day,
I subtracted a little more of my shadow.
What if we get caught?—as if 

discovery were viler than the act itself.
Shame is a junk drawer 
stuffed with marbles and plastic dinosaurs and foreign coins—
every dopamine curiosity I wanted. 

It is his mouth on mother's girdle
I pull tight around my tiny frame. 
My long division was just another way
of ending with zero, an old math,

learned by rote, the no I couldn’t swallow.


"UNABRIDGED"

And when at last you find someone to whom you feel you can pour out your soul, you stop in shock at the words you utter— they are so rusty, so ugly, so meaningless and feeble from being kept in the small cramped dark inside you so long. Yes, I was infatuated with you: I am still. No one has ever heightened such a keen capacity of physical sensation in me. I cut you out because I couldn't stand being a passing fancy. Before I give my body, I must give my thoughts, my mind, my dreams. And you weren't having any of those. I desire the things that will destroy me in the end. Let's face it: I'm scared, scared and frozen. First, I guess I'm afraid for myself... the old primitive urge for survival. It's getting so I live every moment with terrible intensity. It all flowed over me with a screaming ache of pain... remember, remember, this is now, and now, and now. Live it, feel it, cling to it. I want to become acutely aware of all I've taken for granted. When you feel that this may be good-bye, the last time, it hits you harder.


"ELM"

I am terrified by this dark thing
That sleeps in me;
All day I feel its soft, feathery turnings, its malignity.

Clouds pass and disperse.
Are those the faces of love, those pale irretrievables?
Is it for such I agitate my heart?

I am incapable of more knowledge.
What is this, this face
So murderous in its strangle of branches? -

Its snaky acids kiss.
It petrifies the will. These are the isolate, slow faults
That kill, that kill, that kill.


"MY HOLY BOOK"

The world changes too fast. You take your eyes off something that's always been there, and the next minute it's just a memory. We are all specialised forms of survivor. We lack what we fundamentally need and forge ahead regardless, hurriedly hiding our wounds, disguising our ineptitude, bluffing our way through our weaknesses. He thought about history, the hidden human anxieties behind momentous events. The tiny trivial things that were probably bothering Einstein or Darwin or Newton as they formulated their theories: arguments with the landlady, maybe, or concern over a blocked fireplace. The pilots who bombed Dresden, fretting over a phrase in a letter from back home: What did she mean by that? Or what about Columbus, when he was sailing toward the New Land … who knows what was on his mind? The last words spoken to him by an old friend, perhaps, a person not even remembered in history books. People and their dwellings were such a thin dust on the surface of the globe, like invisible specks of bacteria on an orange, and the feeble lights of kebab shops and supermarkets failed utterly to register on the infinities of space above. Locating a past event in measured time was something they could do with great effort, as a special favor, but Peter could tell they didn’t see the point. Why should it matter exactly how many days, weeks, months or years ago a relative had died? A person was either living amongst them or in the ground.


"BUTTERFLY"

Butterfly,
I like the way you wear your wings.
Show me their colors,
For the light is going.
Spread out their edges of gold,
Before the Sandman puts me to sleep
And evening murmurs by.


"FOR EMILY, WHENEVER I MAY FIND HER"

What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alley ways
As I walked on

And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

And when I awoke and felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair with my grateful tears
 

"EVENING"

Now it is dusky,
And the hermit thrush and the black and white warbler
Are singing and answering together.
There is sweetness in the tree,
And fireflies are counting the leaves.
I like this country,
I like the way it has,
But I cannot forget my dream I had of the sea,
The gulls swinging and calling,
And the foamy towers of the waves.


"THE WHEEL REVOLVES"

You were a girl of satin and gauze
Now you are my mountain and waterfall companion.   
Long ago I read those lines of Po Chu I   
Written in his middle age.
Young as I was they touched me.
I never thought in my own middle age   
I would have a beautiful young dancer
To wander with me by falling crystal waters,   
Among mountains of snow and granite,   
Least of all that unlike Po’s girl
She would be my very daughter.

The earth turns towards the sun.   
Summer comes to the mountains.   
Blue grouse drum in the red fir woods   
All the bright long days.
You put blue jay and flicker feathers   
In your hair.
Two and two violet green swallows   
Play over the lake.
The blue birds have come back
To nest on the little island.
The swallows sip water on the wing   
And play at love and dodge and swoop
Just like the swallows that swirl   
Under and over the Ponte Vecchio.   
Light rain crosses the lake
Hissing faintly. After the rain
There are giant puffballs with tortoise shell backs   
At the edge of the meadow.
Snows of a thousand winters
Melt in the sun of one summer.   
Wild cyclamen bloom by the stream.   
Trout veer in the transparent current.
In the evening marmots bark in the rocks.
The Scorpion curls over the glimmering ice field.
A white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets.   
Thunder growls far off.
Our campfire is a single light
Amongst a hundred peaks and waterfalls.
The manifold voices of falling water
Talk all night.
Wrapped in your down bag   
Starlight on your cheeks and eyelids
Your breath comes and goes
In a tiny cloud in the frosty night.
Ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise.
Ten thousand years revolve without change.
All this will never be again.


"THUNDER SHOWER"

The dark cloud raged.
Gone was the morning light.
The big drops darted down:
The storm stood tall on the rose-trees:
And the bees that were getting honey
Out of wet roses,
The hiding bees would not come out of the flowers
Into the rain.


"HELL OF A RIDE"

I remember when I lost my mind
It was a pretty chilly Tuesday night
And the man on the tele said
Build a bunker in your shed
Tell your mum I love her

I'm on day six hundred and thirty-nine
Hello and welcome to my pointless life
Won't you have a slice of pecan pie
Let me show you where I cry
It's in the corner
It's out of order I'm

25, goin on 45, goin on 99, goin on dead
Blink twice, you'll miss the highlights
God it's a hell of a ride, goin on dead

I think of everything I could have been
A superhero in a limousine
Or a hot shot living on top
But instead, look what I've got
The world is on fire so
Baby pass me a lighter - cause I'm...

Looks like the sun's coming out again
And I see my friends and they're over the moon to see me
What a surprise
God I'm glad
I'm alive I'm alive I'm alive


"WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID"

He said it doesn't look good
he said it looks bad in fact real bad
he said I counted thirty-two of them on one lung before
I quit counting them
I said I'm glad I wouldn't want to know
about any more being there than that
he said are you a religious man do you kneel down
in forest groves and let yourself ask for help
when you come to a waterfall
mist blowing against your face and arms
do you stop and ask for understanding at those moments
I said not yet but I intend to start today
he said I'm real sorry he said
I wish I had some other kind of news to give you
I said Amen and he said something else
I didn't catch and not knowing what else to do
and not wanting him to have to repeat it
and me to have to fully digest it
I just looked at him
for a minute and he looked back it was then
I jumped up and shook hands with this man who'd just given me
something no one else on earth had ever given me
I may have even thanked him habit being so strong


"THE FORCE THAT THROUGH THE GREEN FUSE DRIVES THE FLOWER"

The force that through the green fuse drives the flower
Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
Is my destroyer.
And I am dumb to tell the crooked rose
My youth is bent by the same wintry fever.

The force that drives the water through the rocks
Drives my red blood; that dries the mouthing streams
Turns mine to wax.
And I am dumb to mouth unto my veins
How at the mountain spring the same mouth sucks.

The hand that whirls the water in the pool
Stirs the quicksand; that ropes the blowing wind
Hauls my shroud sail.
And I am dumb to tell the hanging man
How of my clay is made the hangman's lime.

The lips of time leech to the fountain head;
Love drips and gathers, but the fallen blood
Shall calm her sores.
And I am dumb to tell a weather's wind
How time has ticked a heaven round the stars.

And I am dumb to tell the lover's tomb
How at my sheet goes the same crooked worm. 


"DOPAMINE"

he is not in the details
as i was often told
not smoking fiery red
no horns
no fork
no tail

no
the devil is in the dopamine
sliding into synapses
overriding receptors
interfering with the best intentions
afferent and efferent impulses
blocked
diverted
enhanced
as love and lust
motivation and addiction
adoration and adultery
swirl in sensual spirals
tiptoe through thoughts
dance across dreams

i am puppet to the stream
of chemicals flowing
never knowing
who controls the rails
on the mesolimbic line
is the engineer today
infernal or divine


"ULTRAVIOLET BLUES"

Her limbs are as firm as math.
She wears three ironic triangles.
Her eyes repeat the sea.
A faint and faintly damp
blond down extends the aura
of her hair. Her lips
do not leave the yogurt cone
they kiss, but if they did,
would speak essences.

The lone, arrested wave
extrudes not foam but hands,
reaching and pointing.
Other beings on the beach,
nonviable in this medium,
are subliminal smoke.
Though the rotation of the planet
is stilled, two are not harmed
though one is ordinary.

Meanwhile the smile exists.
Till a phone rings that offers
the ever-immanent Other,
his imbricated bêtises,
charms, and money.
That sound was always there.
The being beside her
lets sand sift
through his hand, wishing time would return.


"BOMB FRAGMENTS"

I am tasked with reconstructing the explosive device. Most forensic departments analyze via computer these days, but I still do it by hand; I collect bomb fragments and piece the object together. It’s like working on the world’s most complicated jigsaw puzzle. Many of the fragments are twisted from the explosion; I need to reverse-engineer the blast pattern, bending and reshaping the warped pieces into their original configurations. After my labors, the pieces still do not fit perfectly—I don’t make mistakes, so I know I must be missing some bomb fragments. I ask the detectives, and they say there is still shrapnel from the hospital, extracted out of each victim’s wound. The detectives are reluctant, but they eventually surrender their precious evidence. Even with the bloody shrapnel, I’m still missing something, so I return to the scene with a microscope and tweezers, and I find smaller particles overlooked by the crime scene investigators. The metallic jigsaw makes more sense now, gaining definition with each granule. It is not a grenade or a pipe bomb—the emerging shape is too big. I work on the finer features—divots, dimples, cracks, lines—matching every single metal piece to its corresponding microscopic gap. Gradually, the pieces form a recognizable, singular entity. When each bomb fragment finds a home, I have reassembled the shape of a human being, smiling and happy, on the verge of breaking into fiery pieces. There is something very wrong with me, but it is also very good.


"I AM A SPECTROGRAM"

parturition / explosiveness

We pop into the world with all the pent up force of a plosive, followed by an afterbirth of air. Experts in such things claim the afterbirth is prolonged if the mother’s first language is Korean or Tlingit, brief if she speaks Gaelic or Dahalo, but in all cases we are born with the same amount of accompanying pain and pleasure. 

adolescence / aperiodicity

Our time after childhood is noisy, each experience shifting, volatile, indistinguishable from the next. We shout obscenities and protests, frustrations and follies, hissing aerodynamic complexities through our buckteeth while we wait for shapeless bodies to assume less fleeting forms. We are stupid and unappreciative and we are oblivious to how good things are.

pain / sibilance

Screams and shrieks and shivers are signs of something gone awry. They are strident and high-pitched and do not transmit over phone lines at times of stress. Suck it up, sweetheart, gnash your teeth, and remember that if you feel pain, it is because you feel.

sex / glottal

Touch us and swallow us while we swallow you and find yourself in our throats and in dark spaces sealed from the world by larynxes and cervixes whose pulsating rhythms look almost identical under stroboscopic conditions.

love / liquidity

We love fluidly, with the openness of vowels and with minimal constriction, and when love comes easily and early it is clear, watery, like the day. The variations of love—the unrequited, the fading, the lost—are dark and final and look very unlike the kind we long for. None of us is alone in this; light love and dark love are both universals in the world’s lexicon.

age / sonority

With the years come roundness of body and smoothness of thought. I and you morph into nous and noi. We are honest and exposed, strong enough to sing, knowing we face the final stages of an unavoidable weakening process.

death / lenition

When there are no more vowels, we eat our words like syrup through a straw until debuccalization is complete. Life’s sounds disappear inside us, the haches muets of French, the silent Es of English, and there is no more pain or noise when we delete ourselves. There will be other voiceprints and other waveforms, and they will share the features of our own, but they will be unique.

As ours were.


"BE MY ANODYNE"

A language exchange apertivo
in which I question motives
as motorinos: gallant, flowering,
pivoting over asphalt
to avoid pedestrians.
You say I habitually roller-skate
on luxury vehicles for show:
these whispered dents —
indicators of alternative
planes and bifurcations:
Socratic body/soul conundrums,
in a dramatic reading, you
are Plato — I am the source of motion,
but I’ve not yet individualized.
The score: there are bass clefts competing
for over priced voice-overs. Always
the burden of proof, always the unspoken
lizards of apology


"FLOWERS NEVER BEND WITH THE RAINFALL"

Through the corridors of sleep
Past the shadows dark and deep
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.
I don't know what is real,
I can't touch what I feel
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall.

The mirror on my wall
Casts an image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.
I am blinded by the light
Of God and truth and right
And I wander in the night without direction.

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall.

It's no matter if you're born
To play the King or pawn
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow,
So my fantasy
Becomes reality,
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.

So I'll continue to continue to pretend
My life will never end,
And flowers never bend
With the rainfall. 


"STRANGE CONSTELLATIONS"

the empty crater smells like fireworks:
a city block swept away
obliterated between
inbreath
and the outbreath that never came

i saw the pictures:
limbs tangled on asphalt
like strange constellations

i wonder:
will I someday wake with colorless eyes
my smile a split femur
my bone chips star-scattered on dark sand

hear my empty breath
choking full with their names:
gunblast men in black Kevlar
and the children who watch
eyes shot through with grief

i stand on the cracked lip
and I wonder:
when they wrap death against their ribs
do they remember a time before,
a time when their future was written differently
in the crisp spill of stars overhead

i sleep and i dream:
the stars are falling to earth
snow drifts of gaseous clouds
and constellations of names
cover my body
i’m drowning to wake up


"THE BIRDS WE DRANK"

We cockfight with bottles,
grey geese and wild turkeys fly, thrown down
the backs of our gullets, wet and on fire,
the fire, only fire we light
in the fog night contact high of joint magnetism –
the kind where your joints should wrap around mine,
my joints should socket yours –
we should stick together.

Spin that bottle again,
your flair is showing, and my predilections
for lace waistbands and silk bra straps
with zebras underneath that you can’t see
racing, stampeding against this voltaic flesh,
all raised hairs and goosepimples
you brush with jimp fingers
as you set down the shot glass.

Pass the juice around the jungle
we have built in our heaven, in our closet,
in this space that belongs to someone else –
space that will not remember us in the morning,
will not remember undone zippers,
sthenic, sweat-soaked zebras, and the birds we drank
from each the other’s maw beneath blankets
scented with sex and the dope in your pockets.

I don’t even know my name
anymore, I don’t care to know yours, I don’t care
what’s in your pants –you aren’t wearing them,
you’re wearing me, I’m wearing the curve of your skin –
somehow we have pierced each other,
somewhere, further, the dawn silence begs
lingering, for another battle, for cigarettes
and coffee I’ll drink if you will.


"SIMPLE TRANSLATIONS"

even before trees rocks I was nothing
when I’m dead nowhere I’ll be nothing

all the bad things I do will go up in smoke
and so will I

"ART"

Under the white clouds, the snow is falling.
You can’t see the white clouds, or the snow.
Or the cold, or the white glow of the earth.
A solitary man glides downhill on his skis.
The snow is falling.
It falls until the man disappears back into the landscape.
One of my oldest friends, has bought a painting. It’s a canvas
about five foot by four. It represents a man 
who moves across a space and
disappears


"A LIGHT IN THE MOON"

A light in the moon the only light is on Sunday. What was the sensible decision. The sensible decision was that notwithstanding many declarations and more music, not even notwithstanding the choice and a torch and a collection, notwithstanding the celebrating hat and a vacation and even more noise than cutting, notwithstanding Europe and Asia and being overbearing, not even notwithstanding an elephant and a strict occasion, not even withstanding more cultivation and some seasoning, not even with drowning and with the ocean being encircling, not even with more likeness and any cloud, not even with terrific sacrifice of pedestrianism and a special resolution, not even more likely to be pleasing. The care with which the rain is wrong and the green is wrong and the white is wrong, the care with which there is a chair and plenty of breathing. The care with which there is incredible justice and likeness, all this makes a magnificent asparagus, and also a fountain.


"WEDNESDAY MORNING, 3 A.M."

I can hear the soft breathing
Of the girl that I love
As she lies here beside me
Asleep with the night
And her hair, in a fine mist
Floats on my pillow
Reflecting the glow
Of the winter moonlight

She is soft, she is warm
But my heart remains heavy
And I watch as her breasts
Gently rise, gently fall
For I know with the first light of dawn
I'll be leaving
And tonight will be
All I have left to recall

Oh, what have I done,
Why have I done it?
I've committed a crime,
I have broken the law
For twenty-five dollars
And pieces of silver
I held up and robbed
A hard liquor store

My life seems unreal,
My crime an illusion
A scene badly written
In which I must play
Yet I know as I gaze
At my young love beside me
The morning is just a few hours away 


"BLUE"

The snub-nosed monster rises to the surface and spouts through his blunt nostrils two columns of water, which, fiery-white in the centre, spray off into a fringe of blue beads. Strokes of blue line the black tarpaulin of his hide. Slushing the water through mouth and nostrils he sings, heavy with water, and the blue closes over him dowsing the polished pebbles of his eyes. Thrown upon the beach he lies, blunt, obtuse, shedding dry blue scales. Their metallic blue stains the rusty iron on the beach. Blue are the ribs of the wrecked rowing boat. A wave rolls beneath the blue bells. But the cathedral’s different, cold, incense laden, faint blue with the veils of madonnas.


"SUMMER PLAIN"

We have seen so much.
Reality has used us up so much,
but here is summer at last:
a large airield—the light controller is bringing down
load after load of frozen
people from space.
The grass and the lowers—here we land.
The grass has a green manager.
I report myself.


"LOOKING BACK"

Remember me before I was a heap of salt,
the laughing child who seldom did
as she was told or came when she was called,
the merry girl who became Lot’s bride,
the happy woman who loved her wicked city.
Do not remember me with pity.
I saw you plodding on ahead
into the desert of your pitiless faith.
Those springs are dry, that earth is dead.
I looked back, not forward, into death.
Forgiving rains dissolve me, and I come
still disobedient, still happy, home.


"THIS MORNING"

This morning was something. A little snow
lay on the ground. The sun floated in a clear
blue sky. The sea was blue, and blue-green,
as far as the eye could see.
Scarcely a ripple. Calm. I dressed and went
for a walk -- determined not to return
until I took in what Nature had to offer.
I passed close to some old, bent-over trees.
Crossed a field strewn with rocks
where snow had drifted. Kept going
until I reached the bluff.
Where I gazed at the sea, and the sky, and
the gulls wheeling over the white beach
far below. All lovely. All bathed in a pure
cold light. But, as usual, my thoughts
began to wander. I had to will
myself to see what I was seeing
and nothing else. I had to tell myself this is what
mattered, not the other. (And I did see it,
for a minute or two!) For a minute or two
it crowded out the usual musings on
what was right, and what was wrong -- duty,
tender memories, thoughts of death, how I should treat
with my former wife. All the things
I hoped would go away this morning.
The stuff I live with every day. What
I've trampled on in order to stay alive.
But for a minute or two I did forget
myself and everything else. I know I did.
For when I turned back i didn't know
where I was. Until some birds rose up
from the gnarled trees. And flew
in the direction I needed to be going.


"NYQUIL"

Call it iron discipline. But for months
I never took my first drink
before eleven P.M. Not so bad,
considering. This was in the beginning
phase of things. I knew a man
whose drink of choice was Listerine.
He was coming down off Scotch.
He bought Listerine by the case,
and drank it by the case. The back seat
of his car was piled high with dead soldiers.
Those empty bottles of Listerine
gleaming in his scalding back seat!
The sight of it sent me home soul-searching.
I did that once or twice. Everybody does.
Go way down inside and look around.
I spent hours there, but
didn't meet anyone, or see anything
of interest. I came back to the here and now,
and put on my slippers. Fixed
myself a nice glass of NyQuil.
Dragged a chair over to the window.
Where I watched a pale moon struggle to rise
over Cupertino, California.
I waited through hours of darkness with NyQuil.
And then, sweet Jesus! the first sliver
of light.


"THE OLD DAYS"

You'd dozed in front of the TV
but you hadn't been to bed yet
when you called. I was asleep,
or nearly, when the phone rang
You wanted to tell me you'd thrown
a party. And I was missed.
It was like the old days, you
said, and laughed.
Dinner was a disaster
Everybody dead drunk by the time
food hit the table. People
were having a good time, a great
time, a hell of a time, until
somebody took somebody
else's fiancée upstairs. Then
somebody pulled a knife.

But you got in front of the guy
as he was going upstairs
and talked him down.
Disaster narrowly averted,
you said, and laughed again.
You didn't remember much else
of what happened after that.
People got into their coats
and began to leave. You
must have dropped off for a few
minutes in front of the TV
because it was screaming at you
to get it a drink when you woke up.
Anyway, you're in Pittsburgh,
and I'm in here in this
little town on the other side
of the country. Most everyone
has cleared out of our lives now.


"WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID"

He said it doesn't look good
he said it looks bad in fact real bad
he said I counted thirty-two of them on one lung before
I quit counting them
I said I'm glad I wouldn't want to know
about any more being there than that
he said are you a religious man do you kneel down
in forest groves and let yourself ask for help
when you come to a waterfall
mist blowing against your face and arms
do you stop and ask for understanding at those moments
I said not yet but I intend to start today
he said I'm real sorry he said
I wish I had some other kind of news to give you
I said Amen and he said something else
I didn't catch and not knowing what else to do
and not wanting him to have to repeat it
and me to have to fully digest it
I just looked at him
for a minute and he looked back it was then
I jumped up and shook hands with this man who'd just given me
something no one else on earth had ever given me
I may have even thanked him habit being so strong


"HAPPINESS"

So early it's still almost dark out.
I'm near the window with coffee,
and the usual early morning stuff
that passes for thought.
When I see the boy and his friend
walking up the road
to deliver the newspaper.
They wear caps and sweaters,
and one boy has a bag over his shoulder.
They are so happy
they aren't saying anything, these boys.
I think if they could, they would take
each other's arm.
It's early in the morning,
and they are doing this thing together.
They come on, slowly.
The sky is taking on light,
though the moon still hangs pale over the water.
Such beauty that for a minute
death and ambition, even love,
doesn't enter into this.
Happiness. It comes on
unexpectedly. And goes beyond, really,
any early morning talk about it.


"ANCESTRY"

I am such a long way from my ancestors now
in my extreme old age that I feel more one of them
than their descendant. Time comes round
in a bodily way I do not understand. Age undoes itself
and plays the Ouroboros. I the only daughter
have always been one of the tiny grandmothers,
laughing at everything, uncomprehending,
incomprehensible.


"UNDER PRESSURE"

The blue sky’s engine drone is deafening.
We’re living on a shuddering worksite
where the ocean depths can suddenly open up—
shells and telephones hiss.
You can see beauty only from the side, hastily.
The dense grain on the ield, many colors in a yellow stream.
The restless shadows in my head are drawn there.
They want to creep into the grain and turn to gold.
Darkness falls. At midnight I go to bed.
The smaller boat sets out from the larger boat.
You are alone on the water.
Society’s dark hull drifts farther and farther away.


"TRANSFORMATION AND ESCAPE"

I reached heaven and it was syrupy.
It was oppressively sweet.
Croaking substances stuck to my knees.
Of all substances St. Michael was stickiest.
I grabbed him and pasted him on my head.   
I found God a gigantic fly paper.
I stayed out of his way.
I walked where everything smelled of burnt chocolate.   
Meanwhile St. Michael was busy with his sword   
hacking away at my hair.
I found Dante standing naked in a blob of honey.   
Bears were licking his thighs.
I snatched St. Michael’s sword
and quartered myself in a great circular adhesive.   
My torso fell upon an elastic equilibrium.
As though shot from a sling
my torso whizzed at God fly paper.
My legs sank into some unimaginable sog.
My head, though weighed with the weight of St. Michael,   
did not fall.
Fine strands of multi-colored gum
suspended it there.
My spirit stopped by my snared torso.
I pulled! I yanked! Rolled it left to right!
It bruised! It softened! It could not free!
The struggle of an Eternity!
An Eternity of pulls! of yanks!
Went back to my head,
St. Michael had sucked dry my brainpan!
Skull!
My skull!
Only skull in heaven!
Went to my legs.
St. Peter was polishing his sandals with my knees!   
I pounced upon him!
Pummeled his face in sugar in honey in marmalade!   
Under each arm I fled with my legs!
The police of heaven were in hot pursuit!
I hid within the sop of St. Francis.
Gasping in the confectionery of his gentility   
I wept, caressing my intimidated legs.

They caught me.
They took my legs away.
They sentenced me in the firmament of an ass.
The prison of an Eternity!
An Eternity of labor! of hee-haws!
Burdened with the soiled raiment of saints
I schemed escape.
Lugging ampullae its daily fill
I schemed escape.
I schemed climbing impossible mountains.
I schemed under the Virgin’s whip.
I schemed to the sound of celestial joy.
I schemed to the sound of earth,
the wail of infants,   
the groans of men,   
the thud of coffins.   
I schemed escape.
God was busy switching the spheres from hand to hand.   
The time had come.
I cracked my jaws.   
Broke my legs.
Sagged belly-flat on plow
on pitchfork
on scythe.
My spirit leaked from the wounds.
A whole spirit pooled.
I rose from the carcass of my torment.   
I stood in the brink of heaven.
And I swear that Great Territory did quake   
when I fell, free.


"PSYCHE"

I am angry with X, with Y, with Z,
for not being you.
Enthusiasms jump at me,
wagging and barking. Go away.
Go home.

I am angry with my eyes for not seeing you,
they smart and ache and see the snow,
an insistent brilliance.

If I were Psyche how could I not
bring the lamp to our bedside?
I would have known in advance
all the travails my gazing
would bring, more than Psyche
ever imagined,
and even so, how could I not have raised
the amber flame to see
the human person I knew
was to be revealed.
She did not even know! She dreaded
a beast and discovered
a god. But I
know, and hunger
to witness again the form
of mortal love itself.

I am angry with everything that is filling
the space of your absence,
breathing your air.
                           Psyche,
how blessed you were
in the dark, knowing him in your flesh:
I was wrong! If I were Psyche
I would live on in darkness, and endure
the foolish voices, barking of aeolian dogs,
                         the desert glitter
of days full of boring treasures,
walking on precious stones till my feet hurt,

to hold you each night and be held
close in your warmth in a pitchblack cave of a room

and not have to wait
for Mercury, dressed in the sad gray coat of a mailman
and no wings on his feet,
to bring me your words.


"ACTS OF GROUNDING"

Put your neon hands in the air, dig feet
in deep soil, plow, past the crust arc
your spine and its electric uncoiling –

open arms the width of wind, remember
you are dragon, you are parabolas of water
shot skyward, remember to dive –

there is no fall, only spirit and wrought iron
bones, their sway in the stars weaving
will keep a smile in your skull
when the flesh is still warm.


"GUNSONG"

We were not born saviors,
lowly participation trophy knights and fragile birds –
no, the blood of success drained slowly over the table,
        	the last supper of each golden child
        	before the greatest rhetoric failed and forced us
        	kicking and screaming
        	into our own trenches:
we refuse to be seen
crying, hiding instead beneath histories
revised by the bliss of forgetting;
        	we lay hands because it is easier to speak in limbs and lips
        	than with the loaded guns of our tongues,
                    	la dee da da dee da –
one cut is one cut too many, so we dance,
        	two forward,
three back,
        	a tango, a foxtrot,
        	waging our wars in private,
        	where we can take the safety off,
        	and touch our scars
        	and wonder –
	how much peace can we endure?


"CLOUDS"

The clouds as I see them, rising   
urgently, roseate in the   
mounting of somber power

surging in evening haste over   
roofs and hermetic   
grim walls—

                          Last night
as if death had lit a pale light
in your flesh, your flesh
was cold to my touch, or not cold   
but cool, cooling, as if the last traces   
of warmth were still fading in you.
My thigh burned in cold fear where   
yours touched it.

But I forced to mind my vision of a sky   
close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move—
a sky of gray mist it appeared—
and how looking intently at it we saw
its gray was not gray but a milky white
in which radiant traces of opal greens,
fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again,
and how only then, seeing the color in the gray,   
a field sprang into sight, extending
between where we stood and the horizon,

a field of freshest deep spiring grass   
starred with dandelions,
green and gold
gold and green alternating in closewoven   
chords, madrigal field.

Is death’s chill that visited our bed   
other than what it seemed, is it   
a gray to be watched keenly?

Wiping my glasses and leaning westward,   
clearing my mind of the day’s mist and leaning   
into myself to see
the colors of truth

I watch the clouds as I see them   
in pomp advancing, pursuing   
the fallen sun.


"PRAIRIE THREADS"

The cowboys come army riding horses
and cowgirls, wearing boots and weaponized heels,
fucking wagons don’t care for roaming pedestrians
like people who say I live here, or bison, or earth,
no they come bayonet and bullet speed
dressed up to smoke fat cigars and strip
entire lands of spirit traded for gold
and blood sluice under wagon, under machines
that drill the ground that explode mountain into face,
that sew, like you, but faster –
at home the needle has passed through the wall,
the hole that is left pinpricks sunlight
into the ground – you place your eye
beside the passage between shelter and beyond –
the friendly wave of grass, sky
grinning wide white clouds, filtered
daystar burning its way through petals,
pasque and lilac in the changing wind, whistling
a flattening force, a force to reduce
you to two dimensions,
measured in spaghetti thread and whiskey – 
you do not know
the needle is a silent prophet: 
if the wall falls,
the hole remains, wide open –
you could see everything,
but it wouldn’t matter at all.


"EVIDENCE, SYSIPHUS"

This is how the hills layer
oceanic ghosts, ancient

Diluvian waves settling history
cakelike in the heart –

after the sand and the cold
mother’s milk evaporates

into red stratum, bleeding
more and less in bursting grass

pushing the shoots
through the giant’s pillows,

the giant’s corpse, a wake up
calling the land to rise

and raise the forest, pine
and dryad, needles and soft

sheets of shadow – grey
becoming more grey, darker

ever until the valley sinks
beneath the blue that makes

each blade green and grow
(I have so much blue in me)

seeking the sun and further
stars folded over from seas

beyond these four measures
we observe, vestigial and flat,

faultless in their alternating
currents, wet and air flow

from the cliff face, bleeding
where you stand conqueror
atop your gutted failures
falling out of the mountain

you’re trying to move. 
Again.


"LONG STRING OF BLUES"

Life is a train of moods like a string of beads and as we pass through them they prove to be many-colored lenses which paint the world their own hue, and each shows only what lies in it's focus. To find oneself trapped in any one bead, no matter what it's hue, can be deadly. The half-circle of blinding turquoise ocean is this love’s primal scene. That this blue exists makes my life a remarkable one, just to have seen it. To have seen such beautiful things. To find oneself placed in their midst. Choiceless. I returned there yesterday and stood again upon the mountain. But what kind of love is it, really? Don’t fool yourself and call it sublimity. Admit that you have stood in front of a little pile of powdered ultramarine pigment in a glass cup at a museum and felt a stinging desire. But to do what? Liberate it? Purchase it? Ingest it? . . . You might want to reach out and disturb the pile of pigment, for example, first staining your fingers with it, then staining the world. You might want to dilute it and swim in it, you might want to rouge your nipples with it, you might want to paint a virgin’s robe with it. But still you wouldn’t be accessing the blue of it. Not exactly. It calms me to think of blue as the color of death. I have long imagined death's approach as the swell of a wave - a towering wall of blue. You will drown, the world tells me, has always told me. You will descend into a blue underworld, blue with hungry ghosts, Krishna blue, the blue faces of the ones you loved. They all drowned, too. To take a breath of water: does the thought panic or excite you? If you are in love with red then you slit or shoot. If you are in love with blue you fill your pouch with stones good for sucking and head down to the river. Any river will do.


"LIKE FINDING GREENLAND, LOST IN THE RAIN"

Everybody capsizes.
This is what happens
when the body, 
seventy-three percent water,
meets the rest of the ocean:
A great slowing of your heart,
scraps of reflex from infancy,
a displaced volume of habit 
from the lives before –
a swim inside,
the knife of the salt you swallowed,
air you breathed, stabbing through 
seasons of monsoon and landslide.
The ghost of your grandmother,
wrapped in steam, comes like a scream 
from a tea kettle, pouring out wind
for the tired sails of your lungs – 
she tells you about diving,
how maps are not made for navigating 
underwater, anchored 
to the bent floor of a sunken ship.
You rise, steady.
Evaporation is a slower process than drowning – 
the pressure of the sky breaks like a wave
on the numb coast of your skin, a wash,
minerals of hard water and oil slick,
an uncertain baptism of stars 
revealing distant cliffs, a new threshold.


"BASTET"

I stand, as I live and breathe,
practicing the art
of being dead. Maybe,
waiting for war, a kiss, a touch. I know
I am becoming more like a cat,
less like a human – attaching myself
to the floor, the wall, a lap, lapping quietly 
the milk in the darkness. It tastes like the flowers
in my mother’s perfume, honeysuckle,
clay and insecurity. I can feel everything,
even when I can’t see – 
once my eyes overpower the absence of light,
I will purr and be invincible, 
silk in the night, infinite, immovable;
I will rule the world with paws, so supple, 
sheathing fierce claws 
destined for more than drapery.


"ARTS AND SCIENCES"

What if this time I don’t begin with a requiem
or a memento mori with a split pomegranate
and a harem of flies? What if instead I tell you

a sleeping octopus changes colors while dreaming,
or how my gender is sable and softens with all
the gorgeous etceteras of age. No one guessed

a chameleon’s tongue measured longer than
its body, but it unscrolled beyond tail, beyond
reasonable need. We wanted the mystery

of Mona Lisa, but a physician in line at the Louvre
stood staring so long he noticed her thinning hair,
her yellowed eye, and diagnosed her thyroid.

Sometimes it pays to wait. After all, love is
a syllabus of domestic chores with rolling
due dates and extra-credit candlelight. I once

loved someone who hated raspberries. That was
my first mistake. What if this time I love someone
like you who likes fur on a fruit, someone who’s

better at suffering, who doesn’t confuse their
sensitivity with goodness. What if this time
I think of Darwin, who saw a rare orchid

with a nectary a foot long and exclaimed
Good Heavens what insect can suck it. But he knew
that anatomy could not exist unless a moth

evolved a tongue alongside it, some unknown
species with a proboscis long enough to complete
this union. No one believed because no one

had seen it. Victorian women used belladonna
drops to widen their pupils—that Latin word
for little doll—and make their gaze a black mirror

so lovers could see themselves. You push me
back to study it, the best distance for beholding.
Always you lament, torn by this choice of look

or touch, but it’s time, you say, and close your eyes.
I admit it’s easy to spot a forgery with an X-ray—
brushstrokes too quick, rendering too clean,

the first draft the final one. Behind a masterpiece—
lavender swapped for gray, a lamb under the unicorn,
a hundred mistakes proving how difficult it is to

become something. You joke I’m the Isaac Newton
of feelings. I can predict failure’s orbital speed,
can calculate the chess of silence and confession,

or even the path vines will take to injure the brick.
It’s a gift from my last love, who made a study
of his wounds, made me balletic, a cat burglar

in a house of eggshells. But what if this time
I can’t see it all coming—not the coup dressed
in Fahrenheit, not you dressed as Aphrodite,

not how I could ever trust your marble hands
cooling the twin crescents of sweat beneath
my breasts, marvelling at this wealth of apples.


"HOW TO PAINT A WATER LILY"

A green level of lily leaves
Roofs the pond's chamber and paves

The flies' furious arena: study
These, the two minds of this lady.

First observe the air's dragonfly
That eats meat, that bullets by

Or stands in space to take aim;
Others as dangerous comb the hum

Under the trees. There are battle-shouts
And death-cries everywhere hereabouts

But inaudible, so the eyes praise
To see the colours of these flies

Rainbow their arcs, spark, or settle
Cooling like beads of molten metal

Through the spectrum. Think what worse
is the pond-bed's matter of course;

Prehistoric bedragoned times
Crawl that darkness with Latin names,

Have evolved no improvements there,
Jaws for heads, the set stare,

Ignorant of age as of hour—
Now paint the long-necked lily-flower

Which, deep in both worlds, can be still
As a painting, trembling hardly at all

Though the dragonfly alight,
Whatever horror nudge her root.


"DOUBLE RED DAISIES"

Double red daisies, they’re my flowers,
 Which nobody else may grow.  
In a big quarrelsome house like ours  
 They try it sometimes—but no,  
I root them up because they’re my flowers,
 Which nobody else may grow.
 
Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn’t plant it;  
Ben has an iris, but I don’t want it.  
Daisies, double red daisies for me,  
The beautifulest flowers in the garden.
 
Double red daisy, that’s my mark:  
 I paint it in all my books!  
It’s carved high up on the beech-tree bark,  
 How neat and lovely it looks!  
So don’t forget that it’s my trade mark;
 Don’t copy it in your books.  
 
Claire has a tea-rose, but she didn’t plant it;  
Ben has an iris, but I don’t want it.  
Daisies, double red daisies for me,  
The beautifulest flowers in the garden.


"GREEN"

THE ported fingers of glass hang downwards. The light slides down the glass, and drops a pool of green. All day long the ten fingers of the lustre drop green upon the marble. The feathers of parakeets—their harsh cries—sharp blades of palm trees—green, too; green needles glittering in the sun. But the hard glass drips on to the marble; the pools hover above the dessert sand; the camels lurch through them; the pools settle on the marble; rushes edge them; weeds clog them; here and there a white blossom; the frog flops over; at night the stars are set there unbroken. Evening comes, and the shadow sweeps the green over the mantelpiece; the ruffled surface of ocean. No ships come; the aimless waves sway beneath the empty sky. It’s night; the needles drip blots of blue. The green’s out.


"THRUSHES"

Terrifying are the attent sleek thrushes on the lawn,
More coiled steel than living - a poised
Dark deadly eye, those delicate legs
Triggered to stirrings beyond sense - with a start, a bounce,
a stab
Overtake the instant and drag out some writhing thing.
No indolent procrastinations and no yawning states,
No sighs or head-scratchings. Nothing but bounce and stab
And a ravening second.

Is it their single-mind-sized skulls, or a trained
Body, or genius, or a nestful of brats
Gives their days this bullet and automatic
Purpose? Mozart's brain had it, and the shark's mouth
That hungers down the blood-smell even to a leak of its own
Side and devouring of itself: efficiency which
Strikes too streamlined for any doubt to pluck at it
Or obstruction deflect.

With a man it is otherwise. Heroisms on horseback,
Outstripping his desk-diary at a broad desk,
Carving at a tiny ivory ornament
For years: his act worships itself - while for him,
Though he bends to be blent in the prayer, how loud and
above what
Furious spaces of fire do the distracting devils
Orgy and hosannah, under what wilderness
Of black silent waters weep.


"THE MINOTAUR"

The mahogany table-top you smashed
Had been the broad plank top
Of my mother's heirloom sideboard-
Mapped with the scars of my whole life.

That came under the hammer.
That high stool you swung that day
Demented by my being
Twenty minutes late for baby-minding.

'Marvellous!' I shouted, 'Go on,
Smash it into kindling.
That's the stuff you're keeping out of your poems!'
And later, considered and calmer,

'Get that shoulder under your stanzas
And we'll be away.' Deep in the cave of your ear
The goblin snapped his fingers.
So what had I given him?

The bloody end of the skein
That unravelled your marriage,
Left your children echoing
Like tunnels in a labyrinth.

Left your mother a dead-end,
Brought you to the horned, bellowing
Grave of your risen father
And your own corpse in it.


"FOUNDATIONAL SHIFT"

You forget so easily that you are made of water, skin woven like wicker around a balloon. Before you die, IV needle in your arm, hands and faces falling away, before your weakened bladder drains in a final act of humiliation, you ask a human question: “Where does all the water go?” You cannot see the saline in your blood, an infinity of hedrons, awaiting the flame of cremation –pain will evaporate, you will evaporate. A fallen angel or alien or Amitābha will cradle what crystals are left of you, saying: “Water is all the same. What makes us different is the salt.” They will unweave your ghost in the ocean, singing: “You could build a castle with the salt of the dead, you could build a kingdom with the salt of the living - thirty thousand tears for a single body’s alkali.” And you, free of the needles and the flames, will rise alone, a new fortress full of contrary clerics chanting: “There are more pains in life than salt.”


"BUCKET LISTS ARE FOR FOOLS, I SAY, BUT WHEN I FEEL LIKE I'M DYING"

there are some places I would like to go with you. Hell is one of them. I would be naked and you would lose the weight you’ve been worried about. It’s okay. We dream together in isolation. Maybe later we can visit the coast. The flowers are still blooming, and I would very much like to try being a hurricane with you. I will spin quickly, and you will be the eye, and we can dance until the ocean boils and we become too powerful. We can retreat to the mountains. We can become hermits. We can talk about saints and stones and swifts. We can not talk. We can breathe more easily when the rest of the world erases us. When the world ends, we will expect it. We will be asleep after a tender kiss.


"I AM A CATTERPILLAR"

An Atlas moth was found 
in Washington. It is dead now, 
but before, it was something else.
When everything grows too big to hold,
I become a cocoon. I dream of being 
a dress, a blanket, something for a body -
an orgasm, perhaps,
or a coffin. A chariot. A needle. A museum.
I am a framework,
open space, everyone else moves
within. A window. Whenever I am broken, I feel 
I’m on the cusp of something. The edge
of being myself. Someday
they will remove my scaffolding,
let me be nothing
but a collection of arches. A cathedral
held tightly in the shutter of a lover’s lens.


"TRAVELING, AS CURRENTS"

Most nights, I stand on the shore of the riverbank I inherited. I reconcile the sand and the roses, the smoothness of skulls and pebbles forever rolling down hill. I am on intimate terms with curves. I have lived with them forever. I sleep with them. I hold one, unused, delicately behind my teeth. I stare at the ground, the ripples, watch the moon in the movement. She knows curves more seductive than mine, more severe than the river. I want to be her, have the force to move the whole ocean. I am here to meet your shadow, to cradle this landscape together in our understanding arms. I want to make a circle. A circle is complete.

Beneath our perfume, the water whispers;
you meet my quivering with waves,
a steady pulse. Our kisses rustle away
into exile together.


"A PROMISE BETWEEN PHOSPHORUS DAUGHTER'S"

We stole your grandmother’s matchboxes, 
a stockpile large enough for another war. 
Red, white, and blue. You: testing each strike strip, 
dark or flare. Strike anywhere. 
Denim shorts. Lighting a flame with your teeth, 
putting out the fire with your mouth. 
A sweatshirt zipper. In the basement, we scraped 
phosphorus on phosphorus until every box was dead. 
Ash. No matter how wet the summer sky was, 
we were burnt. Here: butterflies. A memory. Smoke 
falling out of your red lips, you told me I could kiss you 
if I swallowed a flame. Flowers. I would have swallowed the sun. 
Please, anywhere. I couldn’t feel my mouth for a week.


"THIS IS FEROCITY"

I ask who I am, and she tells me. A woman who can be loved. A woman who loves in the face of so many extinctions. I am most full of love and endings. Sometimes, I feel like I might explode. I ask how my broken throat could ever be a machine for language, and she tells me. My words are more than slick tongue nestling in another mouth. My words are gatherers and hunters. My words are a celestial map to the softest awe. I am reconciling serendipity with divulgence. Sometimes, I pray to an empty sky to share a secret. I ask how to love a soul instead of the silken architecture of a body, and she tells me. Remember you are nothing but an assembly of waves. Remember you can wash away entire histories. Remember you are more afraid of drowning someone than drowning with them. I dream of engraving a future in the breath that escapes when I smile. Sometimes, I am already an echo. 

In the beginning
a woman held out her heart -
I am not finished expanding


"A FEELING SOMETHING LIKE DANDELION FLUFF"

Nothing is simple about you.
Many bluebirds and I are scattered and broken 
on the cold ground 
our bodies runes for you, letters like tea leaves.

I dream you blindfolded in the wind, 
following the very last sliver of light -
oh, that you might find my silence, 
feel its shape and maybe dance alone with it.

And yet, in this sparkling night I fear you’ll miss me
at the edge the daybreak, edge of the world,
where dreams end and chance begins,
trying to sing.

Will I spend forever wondering if the pull I feel  
is magnetism between souls?
If maybe you feel the same rush as soft as wingbeats
rising from the earth?

The birds and I compare polished stones, gems
we’ve found, none that compare to you.
How could I ever make a worthy gift
for you, who can walk on diamonds as light as a fox?

I will lay here in the weather 
eroding to fragments that might fit 
the setting of someone else’s complicated life - 
another nest.

I expect you
like I expect a spike in my pulse
drumming my meaning into the soil that connects us
a joyful piercing of the air in a shared breath.

When you reach out a hand
it will never be to caress me
but to play the uncertain strings of my uncertain soul,
maybe follow the worn threads to the meadow.


"IT'S A PRETTY DREAM ANYWAY"

Everyone is lonely, and everyone hates being alone. But
I’m not like them. I’ve never been so sure of anything. Maybe her,
maybe. I can’t look back on mistakes and fear mistakes to be made. 
Am I nervous? I am in love with the way the stars hide in the sunlight 
and silently bathe us at night. It’s the same sky, you know,
all old fashioned, dreaming a future full of soft memories. 
She pumps heat into my heart to make the heavens glow, I know,
unlikely, but it’s true. It’s a soft static between us. I hold the words
but can’t let them go. Gravity will follow us down into the river,
where we might find the rain we have so often lost from our eyes -
the rain wants finding the same way we do. That natural kind of love
to fill our hearts with butterflies. I wonder how they got there, I wonder 
if her hands are gentle enough to spin a cocoon with me,
I wonder if maybe, just maybe, I should try dying slower.


"THE SHADE OF THE SKY AT MIDNIGHT IS A MEMORY"

I can’t decide what I want to say. I am a shark unable to stop swimming through a bruise. I am broken and illuminated. I float between walls and walls and walls and walls. Brightness only ever taught me how to burn, to be seen, cast a shadow. Sunlight and breeze are flowing through the transom, in and out like breath is supposed to move when it belongs to someone else. The best love I have known came from dim, quiet spaces, where the world is blurred on the inside for days and days, like yesterday, maybe the day before. 

What would happen if I stopped 
dreaming? I can’t. There are still so many
kinds of blue, and words
I want to swallow
somewhere inside another person. 


"BEAUTY FAILS TO UNDERSTAND ITSELF"

Years ago, a girl I knew ripped your words out of one of her father’s books, so I could put them on my tongue. She knew when she desired something she had to take it. Your words, not mine. She was a theory in the sense that she made me believe in connection. Her lips were dust in a violent storm, rising toward the sky before being laid forever in the ground we all came from. Breathing is a brutality when it isn’t understood as a blessing. Saccharin and acid. This memory is a rainbow that is seen for a quarter of an hour and forgotten until the colors return after each greying of the world. My pulse beats to the rhythm of your original German, even with the paper lost and her body ash. I wear what remains of her face in my occasional smile.

Another shapeless rolling cloud
reminds me of you, Goethe. It is wind borne,
free, and before the day is done 
it will break apart. 


"ENERGY IS CALCULATED AGAINST THE RESISTANCE NEEDED TO CHANGE IT"

Can’t say I hope you’re doing fine, when I know things aren’t fine, that things are pain and the stars are calling and the sky still stays aloft as our insides break down. We share meltdowns and never an honest desire to get better, just find some peace until we greet the darkness or whatever comes after. We’re not sure, but for some reason we know that right now it’s mostly sympathy and survival instinct keeping our cells dividing while we decorate our cells and call them homes. Home is just a chemical reaction, the passing electricity of belonging that hides at the back end of a train of thought. I am trying to understand the rhythm pounding through my nerves. Oh. But look at those clouds. They look just like my trembling hands. 


"METAMATERIAL"

I slipped again last night. Or maybe the night before. Flesh and breath. I was reading about time reflections and the ways force and current can bend the unseen. I see myself in the function of a ray of light, all the dust in me unsettled every afternoon as I try to pour myself through a window. Sometimes an echo breaks off, running quickly in reverse. A little softer. A blind certainty. What am I even made of? I wonder if this is what ghosts are like. The air itself buckles when I breathe in the cotton darkness. I collapse sometimes, even when nobody is watching. It is a momentous occasion, feeling solid, even if I don’t recognize myself. 


"I DREAM ON NIGHTS THE UNIVERSE SHIFTS"

In bed, awake in the dark hours, I think maybe I’m dying now. Maybe that’s enough reason to go home to the rocks and the salt breeze and the sunrise. But I’m not dying any more than I do every night, which is to say it’s happening, but the rate is steady. Like the rotation of the earth. Like watching the flesh of my chest vibrate with my pulse. Like a Polaroid developing itself. I wonder if some morning I might look and my feet will be gone, dissolving as I turn into a ghost. I have heard so many voices and I want to sing their refrains in return. I wonder if whatever energy remains when we die is capable of flight. Is being part of a murmuration something I can do instead of going to heaven? I wonder if whatever energy remains while we’re breathing is capable of healing. My chains will not rattle if my hands cannot hold them. What if love is more like a band-aid and I need to keep replacing it? What if I don’t want to? In the morning I will sing the same songs I always do, in my head, where I exist, running, out of time, in places I have never been and those my ashes have already been scattered at. 


"AN OBSERVATORY IN ROME WATCHES ME APPROACH THE SUN"

I am thinking about microgravity, spinning and orbits. I am still in bed, a tide, a current, rubbing circles around ten thousand nerve endings in my southern hemisphere. Remember drinking the Sea of Tranqulity through a telescope? You held my hand. The same one spinning me into oblivion. I’ve done this so many times. I wonder how many times I will do this before I die. I wonder if anyone else every thinks about my hands and they way they’ve been inside myself. We saw Saturn and it looked like the morning sky collapsed into a ball, a little like me having an orgasm. Tonight I will try to catch a comet with the telescope I bought my wife last Christmas - I will tell her about you and about how hard I came with you in my mind, but now how close I am to sublimating completely. 


"ATLANTIC GYRE, IN WINTER"

Suddenly, everything is piscean anxiety in months that have gone quiet. I am on the tile floor, again. 
A whisper now, I could be half in and hanging half out of the bath, thinking about loss and losing 
and how we should have been fish. Swimming toward home in wet feelings, heavy and salt laden, buoyantly familiar. The inside of a round bowl. The sand and stone circling the Atlantic. Walls in a bathroom where we’ve shut the door even though no one is home. Somewhere above the waterline, past air we could never breathe, is a sun we will never touch. It will never touch us, only show itself part of each day, bright curtains in a dark, shifting thermocline, where we can imagine happiness and then forget about it.


"THE FIRST THING I DO EVERY DAY IS BORROW GOLD"

I slip in and out of the dawn, catch brief frames:
my wife putting on makeup, a cup of tea
deposited between blinks, a weather girl
I don’t recognize smiling about the oncoming cold,
a closed door, breeze whistling through 
a cracked window, the smell of decay
calling me outside to see, already, something new. 

I watch Jupiter vanish into the morning blue
before it dips below the horizon. Think 
for a moment, about you, and death, 
and fading. Get up and walk slowly back to bed. 
The sky is still clear when I wake up, 
and the lonely airplanes look like comets.


"WE PUT FOOD IN THE FREEZER TO SLOW THE ATOMS"

I run hot. When I dance I feel questions hatch across my skin. Every limb of my body angles toward the crematorium. Will I leave a crater inside of anyone? Will it smell like fireworks? I am drawing circles inside the excited tangle of my own breast. What will happen to the waveforms I’ve collected? What has happened to all the other waveforms I’ve been? I’ve been ready to embark on the ocean since birth. Do I have to wait my whole life? Every breath is a taste of wings knocked into my lungs. What does that holy air become if I never speak? Am I fermenting my last words? When I collapse on the cold bathroom tile, I wonder if this is what I will look like when I die. I hold my phone like a Bible, text my wife to pick up my waiting prescriptions, watch videos of icebergs turning over to calm myself down.


"HOLOGRAPHS"

I am dreaming of times that didn’t 
happen. When we met in the woods as children
and said nothing. When we went back
to the same house after a party
we didn’t belong at. The first time
we touched, acknowledging distance
and electricity. When we were water 
together before we evaporated. We were
always the same cloud, always wanting
to kiss the earth and be buried
inside each other. When we danced 
in the living room and when we mouthed
more than each other’s names. When we said 
out loud we probably don’t exist. But here I am. 


"WATER"

The world turns softly
Not to spill its lakes and rivers.
The water is held in its arms
And the sky is held in the water.
What is water,
That pours silver,
And can hold the sky?
